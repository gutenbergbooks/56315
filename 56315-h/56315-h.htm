<h1 title="">Texas Fossils
<br />An Amateur Collector&rsquo;s Handbook</h1>
<p class="center"><b>William H. Matthews III</b><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Almost everyone has seen the fossilized
remains of prehistoric plants or animals.
These might have been the skeleton of a
gigantic dinosaur, the petrified trunk of an
ancient tree, or the shells of snails or
oysters that lived in the great seas that
covered Texas millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Each year more and more people are
learning that these fossils are more than
mere curiosities. Instead, they are realizing
that a good collection of fossils provides
much information about the early history
of our earth, and that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collecting can
be a most enjoyable, fascinating, and rewarding
hobby. It is for these people that
<i>Texas Fossils</i> was written.</p>
<p>This publication is primarily an amateur
collector&rsquo;s handbook and as such offers
many suggestions and aids to those who
would pursue the hobby of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collecting.
It tells, for example, what fossils are,
where and how to collect them, and how
they are used. Suggestions are made as to
how the specimens may be identified and
catalogued, and there are discussions and
illustrations of the main types of plant and
animal fossils. Included also is a simplified
<a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicMap">geologic map</a> of Texas and a brief review
of the geology of the State.</p>
<p><i>Texas Fossils</i> is not a comprehensive
study of the paleontology of Texas. Rather,
it deals primarily with the more common
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Species">species</a> that the average collector is likely
to find. These fossils are illustrated in the
plates and figures, and these illustrations
should be of some help in identifying the
specimens in one&rsquo;s collection. Included for
completeness, however, are sketches and
descriptions of some of the more rare and
unusual fossils, and, for general interest,
there are illustrations and descriptions of
many of the extinct reptiles and mammals
that once inhabited this State.</p>
<p>In addition, a group of selected references
has been included for the reader who
wishes to know more about earth history
and paleontology. Many of these publications
provide references of a more technical
nature for the more advanced or serious
collector, and some of them list excellent
collecting localities.</p>
<p>A minimum of technical terminology has
been used, but terms not commonly found
in dictionaries, or which have not been explained
in the text, are defined in the glossary
(pp. <a class="pgref" href="#Page_111">111</a>-114).</p>

<h2 id="c2">WHAT ARE FOSSILS?</h2>
<p><i>Fossils are the remains or evidence of
ancient plants or animals that have been
preserved in the rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust.</i>
Most fossils represent the preservable hard
parts of some prehistoric organism that
once lived in the area in which the remains
were collected.</p>
<p>The word <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> is derived from the Latin
word <i>fossilis</i>, meaning &ldquo;dug up,&rdquo; and for
many years any unusual object dug out of
the ground was considered to be a &ldquo;fossil.&rdquo;
For this reason some of the earlier books
dealing with fossils include discussions
of rocks, minerals, and other inorganic
objects.</p>
<p>There is much evidence to indicate that
man has been interested in fossils since
the very earliest times, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> shells,
bones, and teeth have been found associated
with the remains of primitive and
prehistoric men. It is quite possible that
the owners of these objects believed that
they possessed supernatural powers, such
as healing properties or the ability to remove
curses.</p>
<p>During the earliest periods of recorded
history, certain Greek scholars found the
remains of fish and sea shells in desert and
mountainous regions. These men were
greatly puzzled by the occurrence of these
objects at such great distances from the sea,
and some of them devoted considerable
time to an explanation of their presence.</p>
<p>In 450 B.C., Herodotus noticed fossils in
the Egyptian desert and correctly concluded
that the Mediterranean Sea had
once been in that area.</p>
<p>Aristotle in 400 B.C. stated that fossils
were organic in origin but that they were
embedded in the rocks as a result of mysterious
plastic forces at work within the
earth. One of his students, Theophrastus
(about 350 B.C.), also believed that fossils
represented some form of life but thought
that they had developed from seeds or eggs
that had been planted in the rocks.</p>
<p>Strabo (about 63 B.C. to A.D. 20) was
another important Greek scholar who attempted
to explain the presence of fossils.
He noted the occurrence of marine fossils
well above sea level and correctly inferred
that the rocks containing them had been
subjected to considerable elevation.</p>
<p>During the &ldquo;Dark Ages&rdquo; fossils were
alternately explained as freaks of nature,
the remains of attempts at special creation,
and devices of the devil which had been
placed in the rocks to lead men astray.
These superstitious beliefs and the opposition
from religious authorities hindered the
study of fossils for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>In approximately the middle of the
fifteenth century the true origin of fossils
was generally accepted, and they were considered
to be the remains of prehistoric
organisms which had been preserved in
the earth&rsquo;s crust. With the definite recognition
of fossils as organic remains, many
of the more primitive theories were discarded
for one just as impractical&mdash;these
remains were considered remnants of the
Great Flood as recorded in the Scriptures.
The resulting controversy between scientists
and theologians lasted for about 300
years.</p>
<p>During the Renaissance several of the
early natural scientists concerned themselves
with investigations of fossils. Noteworthy
among these was Leonardo da
Vinci, the famous Italian artist, naturalist,
and engineer. Leonardo insisted that the
Flood could not be responsible for all
fossils nor for their occurrence in the highest
mountains. He reaffirmed the belief
that fossils were indisputable evidence of
ancient life, and that the sea had once
covered northern Italy. Leonardo explained
that the remains of the animals
that had inhabited this ancient body of
water were buried in the sediments of the
sea floor, and that at some later date in
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
earth history this ocean bottom was elevated
well above sea level to form the
Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries the study of fossils became
firmly established as a science, and since
that time fossils have become increasingly
important to the geologist.</p>
<h2 id="c3">THE STUDY OF FOSSILS</h2>
<p>The study of fossils is called <i>paleontology</i>
(Greek <i>palaios</i>, ancient; <i>ontos</i>, a
being; <i>logos</i>, word or discourse). Information
gathered with the help of paleontology
has greatly increased the knowledge of
ancient plants and animals and of the world
in which they lived.</p>
<p>Fossils represent the remains of such
great numbers and various types of organisms
that paleontologists have found it
helpful to establish four main divisions
within their science.</p>
<h4 id="c4">Paleobotany</h4>
<p>Paleobotany deals with the study of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> plants and the record of the changes
which they have undergone.</p>
<h4 id="c5">Invertebrate Paleontology</h4>
<p>This is the study of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> animals without
a backbone or spinal column. These
include such forms as fossil protozoans
(tiny one-celled animals), snails, clams,
starfish, and worms, and usually represent
the remains of animals that lived in prehistoric
seas.</p>
<p>Because invertebrate remains are the
most common fossils in Texas, this book is
devoted largely to the discussion of invertebrate
fossils and their method of collection.</p>
<h4 id="c6"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">Vertebrate</a> Paleontology</h4>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> paleontologist studies the
fossils of animals which possessed a backbone
or spinal column. The remains of fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
are typical vertebrate fossils.</p>
<h4 id="c7">Micropaleontology</h4>
<p>Micropaleontology is the study of fossils
that are so small that they are best studied
under a microscope. These tiny remains
are called microfossils and usually represent
the shells or fragments of minute
plants or animals. Because of their small
size, microfossils can be brought out of
wells without being damaged by the mechanics
of drilling or coring. For this
reason microfossils are particularly valuable
to the petroleum geologist who uses
them to identify <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> formations thousands
of feet below the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c8">PRESERVATION OF FOSSILS</h2>
<p>The majority of fossils are found in
marine <i>sedimentary rocks.</i> These are rocks
that were formed when salt-water sediments,
such as limy muds, sands, or shell
beds, were compressed and cemented together
to form rocks. Only rarely do fossils
occur in igneous and metamorphic rocks.
The <i>igneous rocks</i> were once hot and
molten and had no life in them, and <i>metamorphic
rocks</i> have been so greatly
changed or distorted that any fossils that
were present in the original <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> have
usually been destroyed or so altered as to
be of little use to the paleontologist.</p>
<p>But even in the sedimentary rocks only
a minute fraction of prehistoric plants and
animals have left any record of their existence.
This is not difficult to understand
in view of the rather rigorous requirements
of fossilization.</p>
<h3 id="c9">REQUIREMENTS OF FOSSILIZATION</h3>
<p>Although a large number of factors
ultimately determine whether an organism
will be fossilized, the three basic requirements
are:</p>
<p>1. <i>The organism should possess hard
parts.</i> These might be shell, bone, teeth, or
the woody tissue of plants. However, under
very favorable conditions of preservation
it is possible for even such fragile material
as an insect or a jellyfish to become
fossilized.</p>
<p>2. <i>The organic remains must escape immediate
destruction after death.</i> If the body
parts of an organism are crushed, decayed,
or badly weathered, this may result in the
alteration or complete destruction of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> record of that particular organism.</p>
<p>3. <i>Rapid burial in a material capable of
retarding decomposition.</i> The type of material
burying the remains usually depends
upon where the organism lived. The remains
of marine animals are common as
fossils because they fall to the sea floor
after death, and here they are covered by
soft muds which will be the shales and
limestones of later geologic periods. The
finer sediments are less likely to damage
the remains, and certain fine-grained
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> limestones in Germany have faithfully
preserved such delicate specimens as
birds, insects, and jellyfishes.</p>
<p>Ash falling from nearby volcanoes has
been known to cover entire forests, and
some of these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> forests have been found
with the trees still standing and in an excellent
state of preservation.</p>
<p>Quicksand and tar are also commonly
responsible for the rapid burial of animals.
The tar acts as a trap to capture the beasts
and as an antiseptic to retard the decomposition
of their hard parts. The Rancho
La Brea tar pit at Los Angeles, California,
is famous for the large number of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
bones that have been recovered from it.
These include such forms as the sabre-tooth
cat, giant ground sloths, and other creatures
that are now extinct. The remains of
certain animals that lived during the Ice
Ages have been incorporated into the ice
or frozen ground, and some of these frozen
remains are famous for their remarkable
degree of preservation.</p>
<h3 id="c10">MISSING PAGES IN THE RECORD</h3>
<p>Although untold numbers of organisms
have lived on the earth in past ages, only a
minute fraction of these have left any
record of their existence. Even if the basic
requirements of fossilization have been fulfilled,
there are still other reasons why
some fossils may never be found.</p>
<p>For example, large numbers of fossils
have been destroyed by erosion or their
hard parts have been dissolved by underground
waters. Others were entombed in
rocks that were later subjected to great
physical change, and fossils enclosed in
these rocks are usually so damaged as to be
unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Then, too, many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> rocks cannot
be studied because they are covered by
water or great thicknesses of sediments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
and still others are situated in places that
are geographically inaccessible. These and
many other problems confront the paleontologist
as he attempts to catalog the plants
and animals of the past.</p>
<p>The missing pages in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> record
become more obvious and more numerous
in the older rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust. This
is because the more ancient rocks have had
more time to be subjected to physical and
chemical change or to be removed by
erosion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2 id="c11">DIFFERENT KINDS OF <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">FOSSIL</a> PRESERVATION</h2>
<p>There are many different ways in which
plants and animals may become fossilized.
The method of preservation is usually dependent
upon (1) the original composition
of the organism, (2) where it lived, and
(3) the forces that affected it after death.</p>
<p>Most paleontologists recognize four major
types of preservation, each being based
upon the composition of the remains or the
changes which they have undergone.</p>
<h3 id="c12">ORIGINAL SOFT PARTS OF ORGANISMS</h3>
<p>This type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> is formed only under
very special conditions of preservation. To
be preserved in this manner, the organism
must be buried in a medium capable of
retarding decomposition of the soft parts.
Materials that have been known to produce
this type of fossilization are frozen soil or
ice, oil-saturated soils, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Amber">amber</a> (fossil
resin). It is also possible for organic remains
to become so desiccated that a
natural mummy is formed. This usually
occurs only in arid or desert regions and
when the remains have been protected
from predators and scavengers.</p>
<p>Probably the best-known examples of
preserved soft parts of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> animals have
been discovered in Alaska and Siberia. The
frozen tundra of these areas has yielded
the remains of large numbers of frozen
mammoths&mdash;a type of extinct elephant (<a href="#plate49">Pl. 49</a>).
Many of these huge beasts have been
buried for as long as 25,000 years, and
their bodies are exposed as the frozen earth
begins to thaw. Some of these giant carcasses
have been so well preserved that
their flesh has been eaten by dogs and their
tusks sold by ivory traders. Many museums
display the original hair and skin of these
elephants, and some have parts of the flesh
and muscle preserved in alcohol.</p>
<p>Original soft parts have also been recovered
from oil-saturated soils in eastern
Poland. These deposits yielded the well-preserved
nose-horn, a foreleg, and part of
the skin of an extinct rhinoceros.</p>
<p>The natural mummies of ground sloths
have been found in caves and volcanic
craters in New Mexico and Arizona. The
extremely dry desert atmosphere permitted
thorough dehydration of the soft parts
before decay set in, and specimens with
portions of the original skin, hair, tendons,
and claws have been discovered.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting and unusual
types of fossilization is preservation in
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Amber">amber</a>. This type of preservation was made
possible when ancient insects were trapped
in the sticky gum that exuded from certain
coniferous trees. With the passing of time this
resin hardened, leaving the insect encased
in a tomb of amber, and some insects
and spiders have been so well preserved
that even fine hairs and muscle tissues may
be studied under the microscope.</p>
<p>Although the preservation of original
soft parts has produced some interesting
and spectacular fossils, this type of fossilization
is relatively rare, and the paleontologist
must usually work with remains
that have been preserved in stone.</p>
<h3 id="c13">ORIGINAL HARD PARTS OF ORGANISMS</h3>
<p>Almost all plants and animals possess
some type of hard parts which are capable
of becoming fossilized. Such hard parts
may consist of the shell material of clams,
oysters, or snails, the teeth or bones of
vertebrates, the exoskeletons of crabs, or
the woody tissue of plants. These hard
parts are composed of various minerals
which are capable of resisting weathering
and chemical action, and fossils of this sort
are relatively common.</p>
<p>Many of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> mollusks found in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks of Texas
have been preserved in this manner. In
some of the specimens the original shell
material is so well preserved that the iridescent
mother-of-pearl layer of the shell
is found virtually intact. This type of preservation
is less common, however, in the
older rocks of the State.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>At certain localities in north and central
Texas the Woodbine sands of Upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
age (geologic time scale and geologic map,
Pls. <a href="#plate1">1</a>, <a href="#plate10">10</a>) contain large numbers
of shark and fish teeth (<a href="#plate37">Pl. 37</a>), fish
scales and vertebrae. The remains of these
vertebrates are unusually well preserved
and are prized by both amateur and professional
collectors.</p>
<h4 id="c14"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">Calcareous</a> Remains</h4>
<p>Hard parts composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a> (calcium
carbonate) are very common among the
invertebrates. This is particularly true of
the shells of clams, snails, and corals. Many
of these shells have been preserved with
little or no evidence of physical change
(<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c15"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phosphatic">Phosphatic</a> Remains</h4>
<p>The bones and teeth of vertebrates and
the exoskeletons of many invertebrates
contain large amounts of calcium phosphate.
Because this compound is particularly
weather resistant, many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phosphatic">phosphatic</a>
remains (such as the fish teeth in the
Woodbine sands) are found in an excellent
state of preservation.</p>
<h4 id="c16"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Siliceous">Siliceous</a> Remains</h4>
<p>Many organisms having skeletal elements
composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a> (silicon dioxide)
have been preserved with little observable
change. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Siliceous">siliceous</a> hard parts of many
microfossils and certain types of sponges
have become fossilized in this manner (<a href="#plate14">Pl. 14</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c17"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">Chitinous</a> Remains</h4>
<p>Some organisms have an <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>
(outer body covering) composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitin">chitin</a>,
a material that is similar to finger nails.
The fossilized <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">chitinous</a> exoskeletons of
arthropods and other organisms are commonly
preserved as thin films of carbon
because of their chemical composition and
method of burial.</p>
<h3 id="c18">ALTERED HARD PARTS OF ORGANISMS</h3>
<p>The original hard parts of an organism
normally undergo great change after
burial. These changes take place in many
ways, but the type of alteration is usually
determined by the composition of the hard
parts and where the organism lived. Some
of the more common processes of alteration
are discussed below.</p>
<h4 id="c19"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Carbonization">Carbonization</a></h4>
<p>This process, known also as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Distillation">distillation</a>
takes place as organic matter slowly decays
after burial. During the process of decomposition,
the organic matter gradually loses
its gases and liquids leaving only a thin
film of carbonaceous material (<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>, fig.
7). This is the same process by which coal
is formed, and large numbers of carbonized
plant fossils have been found in many coal
deposits.</p>
<p>In Texas the carbonized remains of
plants, fish, and certain invertebrates have
been preserved in this manner, and some
of these carbon residues have accurately
recorded even the most minute structures
of these organisms.</p>
<h4 id="c20">Petrifaction or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permineralization">Permineralization</a></h4>
<p>Many fossils have been permineralized
or petrified&mdash;literally turned to stone. This
type of preservation occurs when mineral-bearing
ground waters infiltrate porous
bone, shell, or plant material. These underground
waters deposit their mineral content
in the empty spaces of the hard parts
making them heavier and more resistant to
weathering. Some of the more common
minerals deposited in this manner are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>, and various compounds of iron.</p>
<h4 id="c21"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Replacement">Replacement</a> or Mineralization</h4>
<p>This type of preservation takes place
when the original hard parts of organisms
are removed after being dissolved by
underground water. This is accompanied
by almost simultaneous deposition of other
substances in the resulting voids. Some replaced
fossils will have the original structure
destroyed by the replacing minerals.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Others, as in the case of certain silicified
tree trunks, may be preserved in minute
detail.</p>
<p>Although more than 50 minerals have
been known to replace original organic
structures, the most frequent replacing substances
are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dolomite">dolomite</a> (a calcium
magnesium carbonate), <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>, and certain
iron compounds.</p>
<h5 id="c22"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Replacement">Replacement</a> by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> material</h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">Calcareous</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Replacement">replacement</a> occurs when the
hard parts of an organism are replaced by
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcite">calcite</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dolomite">dolomite</a>, or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Aragonite">aragonite</a> (a mineral
which is composed of calcium carbonate
but which is less stable than calcite). The
exoskeletons of many corals, echinoderms,
brachiopods, and mollusks have been replaced
in this manner.</p>
<h5 id="c23"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Replacement">Replacement</a> by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Siliceous">siliceous</a> material</h5>
<p>When the original organic hard parts
have been replaced by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a> the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> is
said to have undergone <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silicification">silicification</a>, and
this type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Replacement">replacement</a> often produces a
very high degree of preservation. This is
particularly true of the silicified <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>
(geologic time scale, <a href="#plate1">Pl. 1</a>) fossils from the
Glass Mountains in Brewster County. These
fossils are embedded in limestone which
must be dissolved in vats of acid, and after
the enclosing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> has been dissolved the
residue yields an amazing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a> of perfectly
preserved invertebrate fossils (<a href="#plate3">Pl. 3</a>).</p>
<p>Silicified <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> fossils have been
recovered from the Edwards limestone of
central Texas. The silicified <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fauna">fauna</a> is restricted
to a few scattered localities, each
of which may yield many unusually well-preserved
fossils.</p>
<h5 id="c24"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Replacement">Replacement</a> by iron compounds</h5>
<p>Several different iron compounds have
been known to replace organic matter.
Many Texas limestones contain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> snails
and clams which have had their original
shell material replaced by iron compounds
such as limonite, hematite, marcasite, or
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">pyrite</a>. Certain of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>
sandstones of the Texas Gulf Coast area
contain large amounts of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glauconite">glauconite</a> which
commonly replaced organic material.</p>
<p>In some areas entire faunas have been
replaced by iron compounds. Such is the
case in the famous &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pyrite">Pyrite</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> Zone&rdquo; of
the Pawpaw <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> (Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>)
in Tarrant County. The fossils in
this part of the formation are very small or
&ldquo;dwarfed&rdquo; and have been replaced by
limonite, hematite, or pyrite. Ammonites,
clams, snails, and corals are particularly
abundant at this locality.</p>
<h3 id="c25">TRACES OF ORGANISMS</h3>
<p>Fossils consist not only of plant and animal
remains but of any evidence of their
existence. In this type of fossilization there
is no direct evidence of the original organism,
rather there is some definite indication
of the former presence of some ancient
plant or animal. Objects of this sort normally
furnish considerable information as
to the identity or characteristics of the
organism responsible for them.</p>
<h4 id="c26">Molds and Casts</h4>
<p>Many shells, bones, leaves, and other
forms of organic matter are preserved as
molds and casts. If a shell had been pressed
down into the ocean bottom before the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediment</a>
had hardened into <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>, it may have
left the impression of the exterior of the
shell. This impression is known as a <i>mold</i>
(<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>). If at some later time this mold was
filled with another material, this produced
a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cast">cast</a></i>. This cast will show the original external
characteristics of the shell. Such
objects are called <i>external molds</i> if they
show the external features of the hard
parts (<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>, fig. 2) and <i>internal molds</i> (<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>,
fig. 3) if the nature of the inner parts is
shown.</p>
<p>Molds and casts are to be found in almost
all of the fossil-bearing rocks of
Texas, and they make up a large part of
most <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collections. It is particularly
common to find fossil clams and snails preserved
by this method. This is primarily
because their shells are composed of minerals
that are relatively easy to dissolve,
and the original shell material is often
destroyed.</p>

<h4 id="c27">Tracks, Trails, and Burrows</h4>
<p>Many animals have left records of their
movements over dry land or the sea bottom.
Some of these, such as footprints (<a href="#plate4">Pl. 4</a>),
indicate not only the type of animal that
left them but often provide valuable information
about the animal&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p>Thus, the study of a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> of dinosaur
tracks would not only indicate the size and
shape of the foot but also provide some information
as to the weight and length of
the animal. In addition, the type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> containing
the track would help determine
the conditions under which the dinosaur
lived.</p>
<p>Some of the world&rsquo;s most famous dinosaur
tracks are to be found in the Lower
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> limestones in Somervell County,
Texas. These footprints, which are about
110,000,000 years old (<a href="#plate4">Pl. 4</a>), were discovered
in the bed of Paluxy Creek near
the town of Glen Rose. Large segments of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> containing these tracks were collected
by paleontologists of the American
Museum of Natural History in New York
City and the Texas Memorial Museum at
Austin. Great slabs of limestone were transported
to the museums, replaced in their
original position, and are now on display
as mute evidence of the gigantic size of
these tremendous reptiles.</p>
<p>Invertebrates also leave tracks and trails
of their activities, and these markings may
be seen on the surfaces of many sandstone
and limestone deposits. These may be
simple tracks, left as the animal moved
over the surface, or the burrows of crabs or
other burrowing animals. Markings of this
sort provide some evidence of the manner
of locomotion of these organisms and of the
type of environment that they inhabited.</p>
<h4 id="c28">Coprolites</h4>
<p>Coprolites are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> dung or body waste
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). These objects can provide valuable
information as to the food habits or
anatomical structure of the animal that
made them.</p>

<h4 id="c29">Gastroliths</h4>
<p>These highly polished well-rounded
stones (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) are believed to have been
used in the stomachs of reptiles for grinding
the food into smaller pieces. Large
numbers of these &ldquo;stomach stones&rdquo; have
been found with the remains of certain
types of dinosaurs.</p>

<h3 id="c30">PSEUDOFOSSILS</h3>
<p>Among the many inorganic objects
formed by nature there are some that bear
superficial resemblance to plants or animals.
Because they are often mistaken for
organic remains, these objects have been
called <i>pseudofossils</i>, or &ldquo;false fossils.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="c31">Dendrites</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 3.</span> Dendrites. These thin branching mineral deposits bear a marked resemblance to plants, hence they are called pseudofossils.</p>
</div>
<p>Although these closely resemble the remains
of ferns or other plant material
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), dendrites are actually thin incrustations
of manganese dioxide. They are
often found along the bedding planes of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> (geologic time scale,

superficially resemble certain of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>

<p>Since <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slickensides">slickensides</a> are commonly at an
angle to the bedding plane and plant remains
lie parallel to the bedding plane, the
two are usually easily distinguished.</p>
<h4 id="c33">Concretions</h4>
<p>Many shales and sandstones contain
hardened masses of minerals and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> that
are often mistaken for fossils. These
masses, called concretions, are usually
found weathered out of the surrounding
rock and may assume the shape of bones,
flowers, vegetables, turtles, etc. Although
these concretions do not represent organic
remains, it is sometimes possible to find
true fossils inside them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c34">WHERE AND HOW TO COLLECT FOSSILS</h2>
<p>In <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collecting, as in most &ldquo;collecting&rdquo;
hobbies, the key to success lies in
knowing where to look, what equipment to
use, and the most effective methods of collecting.</p>
<h3 id="c35">COLLECTING EQUIPMENT</h3>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> collecting is a relatively inexpensive
hobby because it requires a minimum
of supplies and equipment. However,
as in almost any hobby, there are certain
basic items of equipment that must be acquired.</p>
<h4>Hammer</h4>
<p>The hammer is the basic tool in the collector&rsquo;s
kit. Almost any type of hammer is
satisfactory, but as collecting experience is
gained it may be desirable to get a geologist&rsquo;s
hammer. These hammers, also called
mineralogist&rsquo;s or prospector&rsquo;s picks, are of
two types. One type has a square head on
one end and a pick on the other (<a href="#plate5">Pl. 5</a>):
the other type is similar to a stonemason&rsquo;s
or bricklayer&rsquo;s hammer and has a chisel
end instead of the pointed pick end. The
square head of the hammer is useful in
breaking or chipping harder rocks, and the
chisel or pick end is good for digging, prying,
and splitting soft rocks.</p>
<h4>Collecting Bag</h4>
<p>It will be necessary to have some type of
bag in which to carry equipment, fossils,
and other supplies. A Boy Scout knapsack,
musette bag (<a href="#plate5">Pl. 5</a>), hunting bag, or similar
canvas or leather bag is suitable.</p>
<h4>Chisels</h4>
<p>A pair of chisels is useful when fossils
must be chipped out of the surrounding
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>. Two sizes, preferably &frac12; and 1 inch,
will usually suffice. A small sharp punch
or awl is effective in removing smaller
specimens from the softer rocks.</p>
<h4>Wrapping Materials</h4>
<p>Some specimens are more fragile than
others, and these should be handled with
special care. Several sheets of newspaper
should always be kept in the collecting bag,
and each specimen should be wrapped individually
as it is collected. Such precautions
taken in the field will usually prevent
prized specimens from being broken or
otherwise damaged. In addition to newspaper,
it is wise to carry a supply of tissue
paper in which to wrap more fragile specimens.</p>
<h4>Map, Notebook, and Pencil</h4>
<p>It is most important to have some method
of recording where the fossils were found.
It is very easy to forget where the material
was collected, and one should <i>never</i> rely on
memory. A small pocket-sized notebook is
inexpensive and just the right size to carry
in the field.</p>
<p>A highway or county map should be
used to find the geographic location of each
collecting locality. Maps of Texas counties
can be obtained from the Texas Highway
Department, File D-10, Austin 14, Texas.
These maps come in three different sizes,
but for most purposes the 18&times;25-inch
sheets, with a scale of &frac12; inch = 1 mile,
will be satisfactory. These are available for
all counties and may be purchased at a
nominal price.</p>
<h4>Magnifying Glass</h4>
<p>A magnifying glass or hand lens (<a href="#plate5">Pl. 5</a>)
is useful for looking at small specimens
and will also prove helpful in examining
the finer details of larger fossils. A 10-power
magnification is satisfactory for
most purposes, and several inexpensive
models are available.</p>
<h4>Paper or Cloth Bags</h4>
<p>Small bags are useful in separating
specimens from different localities. Heavy-duty
hardware bags for large rough material
and medium-weight grocery bags
for smaller specimens may be used. Locality
data may be written directly on the
bag or on a label placed inside with the
fossils. As an added precaution some collectors
do both. The more serious collector
may want to use a cloth geological sample
bag (<a href="#plate5">Pl. 5</a>).</p>

<h4>Other Useful Items</h4>
<p>The items described above are those that
are most needed and constitute the basic
equipment of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> hunter. The serious
amateur may wish to include certain additional
items which will place his collecting
on a more professional basis. Some of
these accessory items are:</p>
<p>1. A <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_TopographicMap">topographic map</a></i> of the collecting
area. These are available for many parts of
the State and are published and distributed
at nominal cost by the United States Geological
Survey, Washington, D. C., and/or
Denver, Colorado. The Survey can supply
an index sheet showing all such maps available
for Texas.</p>
<p>2. A <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicMap">geologic map</a></i> of the collecting area
if one is available. The list of publications
of the Bureau of Economic Geology should
be consulted to see if a geologic report or
map of the area has been published. This
list may be obtained without charge from
the Bureau of Economic Geology, The University
of Texas, Austin 12, Texas.</p>
<p>3. The <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicMap">geologic map</a> of Texas</i>. Although
a geologic map of Texas is included in this
publication (<a href="#plate10">Pl. 10</a>), the scale is so small
that its use is somewhat limited. For more
detailed work a larger geologic map in
color (scale: 1 inch = 31.56 miles) may
be ordered from the Bureau. The sale price
is 25 cents.</p>
<p>4. A <i>compass</i> for more accurate location
of collecting localities.</p>
<p>5. <i>Adhesive</i> or <i>masking tape</i>. The locality
information can be written on the
tape and applied directly to the specimen.</p>
<p>6. <i>Paper labels</i> (about 3&times;5 inches). A
properly completed label should be placed
inside each bag of material.</p>
<h3 id="c36">WHERE TO LOOK</h3>
<p>Knowing where to look for fossils is a
very important part of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collecting. It
has already been pointed out that
igneous and metamorphic rocks are not likely to be
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>, but that most fossils are found
in marine sedimentary rocks. These sediments
were deposited under conditions that
were favorable for organisms during life
and which facilitated preservation after
death. Limestones, limy shales, and certain
types of sandstones are typically deposited
under such conditions.</p>
<p>One should look particularly for areas
where rocks formed from marine sediments
lie relatively flat and have not been greatly
disturbed by heat, pressure, and other
physical or chemical changes. If the rocks
appear to have undergone considerable
folding and fracturing, there is great likelihood
that any fossils that were present have
been destroyed or damaged by this action.</p>
<p>Quarries are good places to look but one
should be sure to obtain permission before
entering. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">Rock</a> exposures in quarries are
rather fresh but have undergone some
weathering. Quarries have been opened in
many of the limestone formations of Texas,
and large numbers of fine specimens have
been collected in some of these excavations.
Certain Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> limestones are
useful for road metal, building stone, or in
the manufacture of portland cement, and
extensive quarrying has been undertaken
in the Edwards Plateau region of Texas
(<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>). Bones and petrified wood are frequently
found in sand and gravel quarries
in many parts of the State.</p>
<p>Particular attention should be given to
all railroad and highway cuts as rocks exposed
in this way are usually still in their
original position and are fairly well
weathered. Cuts made by recent construction
are usually more productive after they
have undergone a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> of weathering as
this helps to separate the fossils from their
enclosing rocks.</p>
<p>Gullies, canyons, and stream beds are
also good places to examine. These areas
are continually subjected to the processes
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
of erosion or stream action, and new material
is uncovered year after year.</p>
<p>If there are abandoned coal mines nearby,
the dumps of waste <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> around the
mine shafts could be checked. A careful
examination of such waste may reveal fine
specimens of well-preserved plant fossils.</p>
<p>Coal has been mined in several parts of
Texas, and abandoned shafts or dumps are
still present in some counties. The bituminous
coals of Texas are predominantly
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> in age, and mining has been
carried on in the following counties: Eastland,
Erath, Jack, Palo Pinto, Parker,
Wise, Young.</p>
<h3 id="c37">HOW TO COLLECT</h3>
<p>When a likely collecting spot has been
located, the ground should be examined
very carefully to see if there are any <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>
fragments which contain pieces of shell or
the imprints of leaves or other organisms.</p>
<p>If the fossils have been freed by weathering,
they can be easily picked up and placed
in the bag. Many times, however, it will be
necessary to take the hammer and very
carefully remove the surrounding <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>.
Smaller specimens may be more safely
freed with the careful use of the proper size
chisel by gently tapping the chisel and
gradually chipping away the <i>matrix</i>&mdash;the
rock that is holding the specimen. After
most of the matrix has been removed, the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> should be carefully wrapped and
placed in the collecting bag.</p>
<p>Before leaving a collecting locality, one
should be sure to record its geographic
location and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicAge">geologic age</a> of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> in which
the fossils were found. The place
should be located on the map and the locality
entered in the notebook in such a
manner that it could easily be located again
for additional collecting. If a county or
<a class="gloss" href="#g_TopographicMap">topographic map</a> is available, it is wise to
mark the locality on the map. The geographic
and geologic data should be written
on a label placed in the bag of fossils
collected at that particular locality. In addition,
many collectors find it helpful to
write the locality on the outside of each
bag of fossils.</p>
<p>Material from separate localities should
be kept in individual cloth or paper bags,
and the collector should take every precaution
to keep the labels with their respective
fossils. Remember that <i>a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
without a locality is hardly worth the paper
it is wrapped in</i>.</p>
<p>The collector should <i>always</i> ask the land
owner&rsquo;s permission before entering or collecting
on private property. One should
respect all property, especially livestock
and fences, and leave the area cleaner than
when entered. If these precautions are
observed, future collectors will probably
be welcome to return for additional collecting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c38">CLEANING AND PREPARATION OF FOSSILS</h2>
<p>It is usually necessary to do the final
cleaning and preparation of fossils at home
or in the laboratory, for most fossils
brought in from the field require considerable
preparation before they are ready for
display.</p>
<p>Excess matrix should be carefully removed
with hammer and chisel; blows
should always be directed away from the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>. Smaller tools (needles, tweezers, and
awls) should be used in the final preparation
stage, and one should work carefully
to avoid damaging the specimen. Before
starting the final cleaning, it will be helpful
to place the fossils in water and let them
soak overnight. This will loosen much of
the excess <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>, and most of the softer material
can then be removed with a small
scrub brush or tooth brush. Mounted
needles can be used to clean more delicate
specimens or around the smaller structures
of larger fossils. It may be advisable to use
the magnifying glass when working with
small fossils or with delicate surface structures
of larger specimens.</p>
<p>Broken fossils can be repaired with clear
plastic household cement, and specimens
that are crumbling may be coated with
pure white shellac, thinned collodion, or
clear nail polish. The latter is preferred as
it is not as likely to crack. Fragments of
bone are particularly apt to crumble upon
exposure to the air. This type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> is
normally quite fragile and should be excavated
with great care and shellaced as soon
as dry.</p>
<p>Dilute hydrochloric acid may be used in
removing silicified fossils from a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
matrix. The material to be etched
should be placed in a pottery or glass container
and covered with water. Acid should
then be added to the water very slowly and
until large numbers of bubbles are given
off. Each time the bubbling ceases, more
acid should be added and this process
should be repeated until the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> is free of
matrix. This procedure should be carried
on in a well-ventilated place, and the acid
should be handled with extreme caution.
Hydrochloric acid can cause damage or
serious injury and the fumes are extremely
corrosive.</p>
<h2 id="c39">HOW FOSSILS ARE NAMED</h2>
<p>In order to get the maximum pleasure
out of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collecting, most amateur paleontologists
want to identify and classify the
fossils that they have collected. This requires
some knowledge of how fossils are
classified and how they receive their scientific
names.</p>
<h3 id="c40">THE SCIENCE OF CLASSIFICATION</h3>
<p>The number of organisms, both living and extinct,
is so great that some <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a>
of classification is needed to link them all
together. Many fossils bear distinct similarities
to plants and animals that are
living today, and for this reason paleontological
classification is similar to that
used to classify modern organisms. This
system, known as the system of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_BinomialNomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a></i>,
was first used consistently in
1758 by Linn&eacute; (or Linnaeus), an early
Swedish naturalist.</p>
<p>Scientific names established in accordance
with the principles of <a class="gloss" href="#g_BinomialNomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a> consist
of two parts: the
<i>generic</i> (or <i>genus</i>) name and the <i>trivial</i>
name. These names are commonly derived
from Greek or Latin words which are usually
descriptive of the organism or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
being named. They may, however, be derived
from the names of people or places,
and in such instances the names are always
Latinized. Greek or Latin is used because
they are &ldquo;dead&rdquo; languages and not subject
to change. They are also &ldquo;international&rdquo;
languages in that scientists all over the
world can use the same names regardless
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
of what language they write in. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a>
of binomial nomenclature has led to the development
of the science of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Taxonomy">taxonomy</a></i>, the
systematic classification and naming of
plants and animals according to their relationships.</p>
<h3 id="c41">THE UNITS OF CLASSIFICATION</h3>
<p>The world of organic life has been divided
into the plant and animal kingdoms.
These kingdoms have been further divided
into larger divisions called <i>phyla</i> (from
the Greek word <i>phylon</i>, a race). Each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a>
is composed of organisms with certain
characteristics in common. For example,
all animals with a spinal cord (or notochord)
are assigned to the phylum
Chordata.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> is reduced to smaller divisions
called <i>classes</i>, classes are divided into
<i>orders</i>, orders into <i>families</i>, families into
<i>genera</i>, and each genus is divided into still
smaller units called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Species">species</a></i>. A species may
be further reduced to subspecies, varieties,
or other subspecific categories, but these
need not concern us in a publication of this
nature.</p>
<p>The following table illustrates the use
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_BinomialNomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a> in the classification
of man, a clam, and a dog.</p>

</table>
<p>The generic name and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_TrivialName">trivial name</a>
constitute the <i>scientific name</i> of a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Species">species</a>
and according to this <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a> of classification
the scientific name of all living men
is <i>Homo sapiens</i>. It is obvious that there
are many variations among individual
men, but all men have certain general
characteristics in common and are therefore
placed in the same species.</p>
<p>In a scientific name, the generic name
is always started with a capital letter and
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_TrivialName">trivial name</a> with a small letter. Both
names must be italicized or underlined.</p>
<p>The name of the author (the person who
first described the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>) usually appears
following the scientific name. The date of
the scientific publication containing the
original description of the fossil is often
placed after the author. For example:</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Turrilites worthensis</i> Adkins and Winton 1920</p>
<p>With the large numbers of plants and
animals that are living today, plus those
of the past, random naming would result in
much confusion. For this reason scientists
have established strict rules that must be
followed when a specimen is named. The
strict application of these rules enables
scientists in all parts of the world to assign
scientific names without fear of
duplication.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c42">IDENTIFICATION OF FOSSILS</h2>
<p>The beginning collector is usually content
to know if his specimen is a clam or
a snail or a fern or a palm leaf. But as
the collection grows, it becomes increasingly
desirable to know the scientific name
of each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>.</p>
<p>When he starts to identify fossils it may
be helpful to show them to a geology
teacher if a college or university is nearby.
Most teachers are glad to be of help and
will probably have similar specimens in
their own collections. As all colleges do
not have geology departments, a list of
institutions with geologists on their faculties
is included at the end of this section
of the handbook (<a class="pgref" href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>). In addition,
many of the science teachers in the public
schools are familiar with fossils and can
give helpful suggestions as to how to classify
material.</p>
<p>Museums are also good places from
which to get help. If the museum has a
geological collection, it will be most helpful
to compare specimens with the fossils
in their collections and to ask the museum
personnel for advice. In addition to the
above sources of information, local professional
geologists are usually familiar
with the geology of the local area and the
paleontological literature of the region.</p>
<p>Possibly local librarians can recommend
books, encyclopedias, or other publications
that will be of help. Members of
a local <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> and mineral club, if one is
available, are another source of information.
Many times these collectors can pass
along good ideas and tell exactly which
books to consult.</p>
<p>After books or journals describing the
fossils of the area have been located, the
collected specimens should be closely compared
with any illustrations that are
shown. Each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> should be examined
carefully, its more characteristic features
noted, and it should again be compared
with the illustrations and descriptions in
the book. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> or class to which
the specimen belongs should be determined
first. For example, the genus and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Species">species</a> of a certain fossil may not be
known, but it looks like a snail and accordingly
it is named a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gastropod">gastropod</a> (for
class Gastropoda, the snail class), and
this is, at least, a start in determining the
scientific name of that particular fossil.
The descriptive material in the text of
each reference will usually point out the
more detailed features which will be diagnostic
of the genus or species.</p>
<p>The illustrations and descriptive material
in this publication will also be of
considerable help in identification. Many
illustrations of the more common invertebrate
fossils have been included, but
the publication was not designed primarily
for use in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> identification. Rather, it
is intended to guide the amateur or student
who is interested in fossil collecting, and
to furnish suggestions as to how collecting
may be more effectively pursued.</p>
<h2 id="c43">USE OF IDENTIFICATION KEYS</h2>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> identification keys may be useful
in helping the beginning collector identify
specimens. The collector compares a fossil
with the key description and eliminates
those characters that do not fit the
specimen.</p>
<p>The key used in this handbook is based
primarily on <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Symmetry">symmetry</a></i>&mdash;the orderly arrangement
of the parts of an object with
reference to lines, planes, or points. The
shape of the shell or body, presence or
absence of coiling, and presence or absence
of body partitions are also useful
criteria in identifying fossils. To use the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
key the beginner should know something
about symmetry. Two major types of symmetry
are used in this key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_RadialSymmetry">Radial symmetry</a></i>&mdash;the symmetrical repetition
of parts around an axis. This is the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Symmetry">symmetry</a>
of a wheel, and any vertical section
through the center of the object divides it
into symmetrical halves (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>a).</p>
<p>2. <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Bilateral">Bilateral</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Symmetry">symmetry</a></i>&mdash;the symmetrical duplication
of parts on each side of a plane (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).
The plane divides the object into two
halves that are mirror images of each other.
This is the symmetry of a plank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that many objects
may have both kinds of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Symmetry">symmetry</a>. For
example: A cone when viewed from the
top has <a class="gloss" href="#g_RadialSymmetry">radial symmetry</a> and when viewed
from the side shows <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bilateral">bilateral</a> symmetry
(<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>a, b).</p>

</div>
<p>An illustration of the use of the key on
pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_26">26</a>-27 follows. Assuming that a
specimen displays <a class="gloss" href="#g_RadialSymmetry">radial symmetry</a>, this
means that it belongs under Part I on the
key. If the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> has a tapering, cylindrical,
cone-shaped shell (&ldquo;A&rdquo; on the key),
the subheadings under the &ldquo;A&rdquo; part of the
key are examined. Should the specimen
have a shell which is round, tapering at one
end, with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Transverse">transverse</a> septa or sutures
(number 2 under &ldquo;A&rdquo;), it is probably a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cephalopod">cephalopod</a>. This is indicated on the right
hand side of the page. Number 1 under
&ldquo;A&rdquo; is eliminated because the fossil did
not have <a class="gloss" href="#g_Longitudinal">longitudinal</a> radial partitions
within the shell.</p>
<p>Some fossils display no apparent <a class="gloss" href="#g_Symmetry">symmetry</a>
and such a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> would be referred
to Part III of the key. If this fossil had
internal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Transverse">transverse</a> partitions &ldquo;A&rdquo; would
be eliminated. If the fossil was not a coiled
fossil &ldquo;B&rdquo; would also be eliminated and we
would proceed directly to &ldquo;C&rdquo;&mdash;uncoiled
fossils. If the specimen is a branching twig-like
fossil, numbers 1, 2, and 3 would be
eliminated and the specimen referred to
number 4 (Branching twig-like fossils).
Should the specimen have evenly distributed
relatively large openings with
radial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Longitudinal">longitudinal</a> partitions or septa, the
specimen is probably a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coral">coral</a> (&ldquo;b&rdquo;
under number 4 on the key). The &ldquo;a&rdquo; part
of number 4 would be eliminated because
the coral had large openings and radial longitudinal septa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Once a tentative identification has been
made from the key, pictures and descriptions
of this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> group are examined to
establish a more precise identification. It
should be remembered that keys are not
perfect, and the collector should not expect
to be able to identify every specimen with
this key.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c46">CATALOGING THE COLLECTION</h2>
<p>After the fossils have been cleaned and
tentatively identified, they should be cataloged.
This is necessary to enable the
collector to have a record of his collection
and to furnish as much information as
possible about each individual <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>.</p>
<p>The collecting data can be taken from the
labels that were placed in each bag of
fossils as they were collected, or from the
field notebook. Actually, it is wise to check
one against the other. This information
should then be entered in some type of
record book and also placed on a more
permanent label which is put in the tray or
box with the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>. The catalog and label
should contain such pertinent data as (1)
the scientific name of the fossil, (2) the
geologic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> from which the specimen
was collected, (3) the exact geographic
location of the collecting locality, (4)
the name of the collector, (5) the date
the fossil was collected, and (6) the catalog
number of the specimen. The latter is
usually placed in the upper right hand
corner of the label (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) and corresponds
with a like number in the record book.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span> A <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopod</a> showing the catalog number on it, and the accompanying label that pertains to the specimen.</p>
</div>
<p>The entries in the catalog should be
numbered consecutively, and all specimens
from the same locality should bear the
same number. This number should be written
on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> with India ink, preferably
on any remaining matrix or on some inconspicuous
part of the specimen (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). If
the surface of the fossil is too coarse or
porous for ink, the catalog number can be
written on a small patch of white enamel
or clear nail polish painted on the specimen.
After the ink has dried it should be
coated with a dab of clear shellac or clear
nail polish to help preserve the number. If
each specimen is numbered, it can easily
be identified even if it should become separated
from its label.</p>
<h2 id="c47">HOW FOSSILS ARE USED</h2>
<p>Fossils are useful in a number of different
ways, for each specimen provides
some information about when it lived,
where it lived, and how it lived.</p>
<p>Fossils are very important, for example,
in tracing the development of the plants
and animals of our earth. This is possible
because the fossils in the older rocks are
usually primitive and relatively simple;
but a study of similar specimens that lived
in later geologic time shows that the fossils
become progressively more complex and
more advanced in the younger rocks.</p>
<p>Some fossils, for example, the reef-building
corals, appear to have always lived
under much the same conditions as they
live today. Hence, it is reasonably certain
that the rocks containing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Reef">reef</a> corals
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
found in place (that is, where they were
originally buried), were deposited in
warm, fairly shallow, salt water. By studying
the occurrence and distribution of such
marine fossils, it is possible to outline the
location and extent of prehistoric seas.
Moreover, the type of fossils present will
frequently give some indication as to the
bottom conditions, depth, temperature, and
salinity of these ancient bodies of water.</p>
<p>Probably the most important use of fossils
is for purposes of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Correlation">correlation</a></i>&mdash;the
process of demonstrating that certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>
layers are closely related to each other. By
correlating or &ldquo;matching&rdquo; the beds containing
specific fossils, it is possible to determine
the distribution of geologic units
of similar age. Some fossils have a very
limited vertical or <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicRange">geologic range</a> and a
wide horizontal or geographic range. In
other words, they lived but a relatively
short <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> in geologic time but were
rather widely distributed during their relatively
short life. Such fossils are known as
<i>index fossils</i> or <i>guide fossils</i> and are especially
useful in correlation because they are
normally only associated with rocks of one
certain age.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="370" />
<p class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 7.</span> Sketches of two types of micropaleontological slides. (a) Multiple space faunal slide. (b) Single-hole slide.</p>
</div>
<p>Microfossils are often very valuable as
guide fossils for the petroleum geologist.
The micropaleontologist washes the well
cuttings from the drill hole and separates
the tiny fossils from the surrounding rocks.
The specimens are then mounted on special
slides (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>) and studied under the microscope.
Information derived from these fossils
often provides valuable data on the age
of the subsurface <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> and the possibilities
of oil production. Microfossils are
particularly valuable in the oil fields of
the Gulf Coast region of Texas. In fact,
some of the oil-producing zones in this area
have even been named for certain key
genera of microfossils. For example, the
&ldquo;het&rdquo; zone of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oligocene">Oligocene</a> age (geologic time scale, <a href="#plate1">Pl. 1</a>)
is named for the genus <i>Heterostegina</i>,
which is a tiny one-celled animal.
Other microfossils, such as fusulinids,
ostracodes, spores, and pollens, are also
used to identify subsurface formations in
many other parts of the State.</p>
<p>Plant fossils are very useful as climatic
indicators but are not too reliable for purposes
of age determination. They do, however,
provide much information about the
development of plants throughout geologic time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c48">GEOLOGIC HISTORY</h2>
<p>The geologic history of our earth has
been recorded primarily in marine sedimentary rocks,
and this record indicates
that our earth is very old and that life has
been present for many millions of years.
The earth is not only extremely old (more
than 3&frac12; billion years of age), but it has
also undergone many changes which have
taken place slowly but steadily and have
greatly affected both the earth and its inhabitants.
The earth&rsquo;s physical features
have not always been as they are seen
today. Geologic research has shown that
mountains now occupy the sites of ancient
seas, and that coal is being mined where
swamps existed millions of years ago.
Furthermore, there is much evidence to
indicate that plants and animals have also
undergone great change. The trend of this
organic change is, in general, toward more
complex and advanced forms of life, but
some forms have remained virtually unchanged
and others have become extinct.</p>
<p>In order to interpret geologic history,
the earth scientist must attempt to gather
evidence of the great changes in climate,
geography, and life that took place in the
geologic past. The record of these changes
can be found in the rocks, and here is
found the story of the various events in
earth history.</p>
<h3 id="c49">GEOLOGIC COLUMN AND TIME SCALE</h3>
<p>In order to discuss fossils and the age
of the rocks containing them, it is necessary
to become familiar with the <i>geologic column</i> and
the <i>geologic time scale</i> (<a href="#plate1">Pl. 1</a>).</p>
<p>The <i>geologic column</i> refers to the total
succession of rocks, from the oldest to
most recent, that are found either locally
or in the entire earth. Thus, the geologic column of Texas
includes all <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> divisions
known to be present in this State. By referring
to the geologic column previously
worked out for any given area, the
geologist can determine what type of rocks
he might expect to find in that particular
region.</p>
<p>The <i>geologic time scale</i> is composed of
units which represent intervals of geologic time,
during which were deposited the
rocks represented in the geologic column.
These time units are used by the geologist
to date the events that have taken place in
the geologic past.</p>
<p>The largest unit of geologic time is an
era, and each era is divided into smaller
time units called <i>periods</i>. A <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> of
geologic time is divided into <i>epochs</i>,
which, in turn, may be subdivided into
still smaller units. The geologic time scale
might be roughly compared to the calendar
in which the year is divided into
months, months into weeks, and weeks
into days. Unlike years, however, geologic time units
are arbitrary and of unequal
duration, and the geologist cannot be positive
about the exact length of time involved
in each unit. The time scale does, however,
provide a standard by which he can discuss
the age of fossils and their surrounding
rocks. By referring to the time scale
it may be possible, for instance, to state
that a certain event occurred during the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> era in the same sense that one
might say that something happened during
the American Revolution.</p>
<p>There are five eras of geologic time,
and each has been given a name that is
descriptive of the degree of life development
that characterizes that era. Hence,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> means &ldquo;ancient-life,&rdquo; and the
era was so named because of the relatively
simple and ancient stage of life
development.</p>
<p>The eras, a guide to their pronunciation,
and the literal translation of each name is
shown below.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> (SEE-no-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;recent-life&rdquo;</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> (MES-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;middle-life&rdquo;</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> (PAY-lee-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;ancient-life&rdquo;</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> (PRO-ter-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;primitive-life&rdquo;</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archeozoic">Archeozoic</a> (AR-kee-o-zo-ic)&mdash;&ldquo;beginning-life&rdquo;</dt></dl>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archeozoic">Archeozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> rocks are
commonly grouped together and referred
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
to as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Precambrian">Precambrian</a> in age. The Precambrian
rocks have been greatly contorted
and metamorphosed, and the record
of this portion of earth history is most
difficult to interpret. Precambrian time represents
that portion of geologic time from
the beginning of earth history until
the deposition of the earliest <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> strata. If the earth is as old as
is believed, Precambrian time may represent
as much as 85 percent of all geologic time.</p>
<p>The <i>oldest</i> era is at the <i>bottom</i> of the
list because this part of geologic time transpired
first and was then followed by
the successively younger eras which are
placed above it. Therefore, the geologic time scale is
always read <i>from the bottom
of the chart upward</i>. This is, of course,
the order in which the various portions of
geologic time occurred and during which
the corresponding rocks were formed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, each of the eras
has been divided into periods, and most of
these periods derive their names from the
regions in which the rocks of each were
first studied. For example, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>
rocks of North America were first
studied in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> era has been divided into
seven periods of geologic time. With the
oldest at the bottom of the list, these
periods and the source of their names are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> (PUR-me-un)&mdash;from the Province of Perm in Russia</dt>

<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> (KAM-bri-un)&mdash;from the Latin word <i>Cambria</i>, meaning Wales</dt></dl>
<p>The Carboniferous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> in Europe includes
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>
periods of North America. Although
this classification is no longer used
in the United States, the term Carboniferous
will be found in many of the earlier
geological publications and on many of
the earlier geologic maps.</p>
<p>The periods of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era and the
source of their names are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> (cre-TAY-shus)&mdash;from the Latin word <i>creta</i>, meaning chalky</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> (joo-RAS-ik)&mdash;from the Jura Mountains of Europe</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> (try-ASS-ik)&mdash;from the Latin word <i>triad</i>, meaning three</dt></dl>
<p><a id="txcret">In</a> Texas, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> has two divisions,
known as either Lower Cretaceous
and Upper Cretaceous or as Comanche
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> and Gulf series, respectively. These
designations are for rocks of nearly equivalent
age, and both sets of terms have been
used by geologists and in publications. In
this handbook, both sets of terms are used
interchangeably, that is, Lower Cretaceous
and/or Comanche series and Upper Cretaceous
and/or Gulf series.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> periods derived their
names from an old outdated <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a> of
classification which divided all of the
earth&rsquo;s rocks into four groups. The two
divisions listed below are the only names
of this system which are still in use:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Quaternary">Quaternary</a> (kwah-TUR-nuh-ri)</dt>
<dt><a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> (TUR-shi-ri)</dt></dl>
<p>While the units discussed above are the
major divisions of geologic <i>time</i>, the geologist
usually works with smaller units of
<i>rocks</i> called <i>formations</i>. A geologic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a>
is identified and established on the
basis of definite physical and chemical
characteristics of the rocks. Formations
are usually given geographic names which
are combined with the type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> that
makes up the bulk of the formation. For
example, the Beaumont clay was named
from clay deposits that are found in and
around Beaumont, Texas.</p>
<h3 id="c50">THE GEOLOGY OF TEXAS</h3>
<p>The geologic history of Texas, like the
geologic history of the rest of the earth, is
recorded primarily in marine sedimentary rocks.
These rocks provide some knowledge
of the early geography and the first
inhabitants of what is now the State of
Texas. Most of these rocks were formed
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
from sediments deposited in shallow seas
which covered parts of the State at various
times in earth history.</p>
<p>By studying these rocks and their relations
to each other, geologists have established
a geologic column for Texas.</p>
<h4 id="c51"><span class="center">Physiography</span></h4>
<p>In order to discuss the distribution and
exposures of the rocks of Texas, it is helpful
to be familiar with the <i>physiography</i> of
the State. Physiography deals with the
study of the origin and description of land
forms, such as mountains, valleys, and
plains. <a href="#plate9">Plate 9</a> is a map of Texas which
shows the major physiographic provinces
within the State.</p>
<p>The majority of the land forms in Texas
have been produced by the processes of
erosion attacking the structural features of
an area. Certain other land forms may be
related to the effects of igneous activity
which resulted in the accumulation of
large masses of igneous rocks. The Davis
Mountains are an example of surface features
produced in this manner.</p>
<p>In discussing the physiography of
Texas, three major physiographic provinces
will be recognized. These are (1) the
Trans-Pecos region, (2) the Texas Plains,
and (3) the Gulf Coastal Plain (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>).</p>
<h4 id="c52"><span class="center small">TRANS-PECOS REGION</span></h4>
<p>The Trans-Pecos region, located in the
westernmost part of the State, is an area of
mountains and plateaus with broad basins
between the major mountain ranges. Many
different types of rocks are exposed in
Trans-Pecos Texas and these include
marine, fresh-water, and terrestrial deposits.
In many areas igneous rocks flowed
out on the surface and now overlie sedimentary rocks.
There are also many places
where igneous rocks have been injected
into the surrounding rocks, and these
igneous rocks have been exposed by later
erosion.</p>
<p>Included within this area is the Van
Horn uplift of southern Hudspeth and
Culberson counties, the Solitario uplift of
southern Presidio and Brewster counties,
and the Marathon uplift of northeast
Brewster County. This region also includes
the Big Bend area of Texas, a part of
which has been set aside as a National
Park where many interesting and important

<p>Numerous invertebrate fossils occur in

<h4 id="c53"><span class="center small">TEXAS PLAINS</span></h4>
<p>The plains of Texas are broad expanses
of country with very little surface relief.
Most of the plains support grasses and
some have wooded areas, particularly
along stream valleys.</p>
<p>The plains of the northwestern part of
the State have been subdivided as follows.</p>
<h4 id="c54">High Plains</h4>
<p>This area (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>), often called &ldquo;the
caprock,&rdquo; is an elevated plateau which
rises above the rolling plains which surround
it. The High Plains are bounded by
the Pecos River valley on the south, southeast,
and west and by the North-Central
Plains on the east.</p>
<p>The surface of the High Plains is very
flat and characterized by a sparse cover
of grasses and few trees. The surface strata
consist largely of unconsolidated deposits
of sands and gravels of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Quaternary">Quaternary</a> and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> age, with remnants of Lower
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> limestones along the southern
margin. The rocks of the High Plains are
mostly unfossiliferous, but mammalian remains
have been found at several
localities.</p>

<h4 id="c55">North-Central Plains</h4>
<p>Surface strata of the North-Central
Plains (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>) are westward-dipping
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a>
rocks. Present also are extensive exposures
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Quaternary">Quaternary</a> sands and gravels which
trend north-south across the central portion
of the region. The area is bounded on
the west by the High Plains, on the east by
the Grand Prairie, and on the south by
the Edwards Plateau and Llano uplift.
Many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> fossils have been collected
from the Permian and Triassic rocks of
this area. There are also many excellent
outcrops of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> Pennsylvanian
formations in the North-Central Plains
region.</p>
<h4 id="c56">Edwards Plateau</h4>
<p>The Edwards Plateau (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>) is located
in south-central Texas and is bounded on
the south by the Balcones <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a> zone and
on the north by the North-Central Plains.
The surface of the area is typically flat
with a gentle slope to the south. The rocks
of the Edwards Plateau consist primarily
of Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> limestones and shales,
many of which are very <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>.</p>
<h4 id="c57">Grand Prairie</h4>
<p>This area (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>) has a relatively flat
surface but there are areas of gently rolling
hills. The eastern boundary of the Grand
Prairie is marked partly by the Balcones
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a> zone. North of McLennan County,
however, the Balcones fault zone is not
expressed at the surface and in this area
the eastern boundary is defined by the
western edge of the Woodbine exposures.
Upper and Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks occur
at the surface and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dip">dip</a> to the southeast;
many of these rocks contain a large number
of invertebrate fossils.</p>
<h4 id="c58">Llano Uplift</h4>
<p>The Llano uplift (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>) is located in
the central part of the State where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Precambrian">Precambrian</a>
igneous and metamorphic rocks
and sedimentary rocks of early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>
age occur on the surface. The area, which
now appears as a basin-shaped depression,
was at one time covered by Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
rocks and perhaps also by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> strata.
These have since been removed by erosion.
The east, south, and west sides of the uplift
are surrounded by Lower Cretaceous rocks,
and the northern margin is marked by the
Mississippian and Pennsylvanian formations
of the North-Central Plains. The area
is, in general, composed of unfossiliferous
rocks, but some invertebrate fossils (primarily
trilobites and brachiopods) have
been collected.</p>
<h4 id="c59"><span class="center small">GULF COASTAL PLAIN</span></h4>
<p>The Gulf Coastal Plain (<a href="#plate9">Pl. 9</a>) is composed
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Quaternary">Quaternary</a>
rocks and includes the eastern, southeastern,
and southern portions of the State.
The rocks of the area consist of sands,
clays, shales, and limestones. The Texas
Gulf Coastal Plain is bounded on the north
and west by the Balcones <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fault">fault</a> zone, on
the south and southwest by the Gulf of
Mexico, and extends eastward into Arkansas
and Louisiana.</p>
<p>The region has broad river valleys and
uplands of low relief, but there is an increase
in relief toward the interior of the
State. The surface of the area slopes gradually
toward the Gulf and successively
younger formations are encountered gulfward.</p>
<p>The rocks of the Texas Gulf Coastal
Plain are relatively unfossiliferous, but
many of the Upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks contain
fossils. In the central portion of the
region some marine formations of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>
age locally contain well-preserved invertebrate
fossils.</p>
<h3 id="c60"><span class="center">Geology</span></h3>
<p>Geologic studies of the State of Texas

<p>One of the best ways to become acquainted
with the geology of Texas is to
study the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicMap">geologic map</a></i> of the State (<a href="#plate10">Pl. 10</a>).
A geologic map shows the distribution
and age of surface rocks and may also
indicate what kind of geologic structures
are present. The types of rocks that crop
out at the surface may be shown by means
of symbols, colors, or patterns, and these
are explained by a legend which accompanies
the map. On <a href="#plate10">Plate 10</a>, colors are
used to show the distribution and <a class="gloss" href="#g_GeologicAge">geologic age</a> of the
surface rocks of Texas. Reference
to this map will give the collector
some idea of the age of the fossils that
might be found in a given area. Some special
geologic maps may have the location
of geologic structures and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> contacts
indicated by means of symbols, such
as dashed lines, arrows, and similar special
markings. However, the map included in
this publication does not show any of these
special markings.</p>
<h4 id="c61"><span class="center small"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Precambrian">PRECAMBRIAN</a> ROCKS</span></h4>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Precambrian">Precambrian</a> rocks of Texas are
composed of igneous and metamorphic
rocks and some sedimentary rocks. Most of
the Precambrian outcrops are in the Llano
uplift and El Paso and Van Horn regions.</p>
<p>Alterations produced by vast amounts of
time, heat, and pressure have obliterated
any trace of fossils that may have been
present in these rocks. With the exception
of some questionable primitive plants collected
in the Van Horn region, no <a class="gloss" href="#g_Precambrian">Precambrian</a>
fossils have been reported from
Texas.</p>
<h4 id="c62"><span class="center small"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">PALEOZOIC</a> ROCKS</span></h4>
<p>Rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> age are widespread
in Texas, and rocks of each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> are well
exposed. Outcrops are found in the Llano
uplift, North-Central Plains, and Trans-Pecos
region. The most extensive exposures
are of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> age,
and the former are highly <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> in
parts of the North-Central Plains.</p>
<h5 id="c63"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a></h5>
<p>Rocks of late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> age are exposed
in the Llano, Marathon, and Solitario uplifts,
and the Franklin Mountains near El
Paso. These are sedimentary rocks consisting
of conglomerates, sandstones, shales,
limestones, and some dolomites.</p>
<p>Some of these formations are relatively
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>, but the specimens are commonly
fragmental and very poorly preserved.
Fossils that are apt to be found in
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> rocks of the Llano uplift include
brachiopods, gastropods, trilobites,
and small rounded objects believed to have
been formed by algae (primitive one-celled
plants). In other parts of the State, Cambrian
rocks are sparsely fossiliferous and
the fossils consist primarily of fragmental
brachiopods, trilobites, and algae.</p>
<h5 id="c64"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a></h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> outcrops are present in the
Llano uplift of central Texas and in the
Marathon, Solitario, El Paso, and Van
Horn regions of Trans-Pecos Texas. These
are sedimentary rocks and consist largely
of sandstones, cherts, limestones, and dolomites.</p>
<p>Although some of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> formations
are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>, they are seldom collected
by amateur paleontologists because
they are exposed in relatively inaccessible
places and the fossils are usually poorly
preserved. Ordovician fossils reported
from Texas include sponges, corals, brachiopods,
gastropods, cephalopods, and
trilobites. In addition, the Marathon <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a>
of the Marathon uplift contains large
numbers of well-preserved graptolites (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>).</p>
<h5 id="c65"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Silurian">Silurian</a></h5>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silurian">Silurian</a> of Texas is poorly represented
in surface exposures, and only one
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a>, the Fusselman, has been described.
The Fusselman crops out in the
El Paso and Van Horn regions where it
is a white dolomitic limestone. Fossils are
not abundant in this formation, but brachiopods
and corals have been collected at
a few localities.</p>
<h5 id="c66"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a></h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a> rocks are best developed in
Trans-Pecos Texas, especially in the Marathon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
El Paso, and Van Horn regions. In
addition to the Trans-Pecos exposures,
there are minor outcrops of Devonian rocks
in the Llano uplift of central Texas.</p>
<p>Fossils are rare and fragmental in the
Trans-Pecos exposures and consist primarily
of radiolarians and brachiopods.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a> rocks of central Texas are
predominantly <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> and, although
the material is usually poorly preserved,
many fossils have been collected from
them. These include bryozoans, corals,
brachiopods, gastropods, and trilobites.
Conodonts and fragments of primitive
armored fishes (<a href="#plate37">Pl. 37</a>) have also been
reported.</p>
<h5 id="c67"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a></h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a> rocks are exposed in the
Llano region and in the Hueco Mountains
of the Trans-Pecos area. The Trans-Pecos
rocks primarily contain brachiopods with
some bryozoans and gastropods.</p>
<p>The central Texas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a> rocks
are much more <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> and some of
the material is well preserved. Fossils reported
from this area include brachiopods
(<a href="#plate17">Pl. 17</a>), crinoids, gastropods, cephalopods,
trilobites, and ostracodes.</p>
<h5 id="c68"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a></h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> rocks are well represented
in Texas and are exposed in the
Llano uplift, north-central Texas, and
Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<p>In Trans-Pecos Texas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> rocks
crop out in the Hueco and Diablo Mountains.
Fossils found in this area are algae,
fusulinids, corals, brachiopods, pelecypods,
gastropods, cephalopods, and crinoids.
There is also a thick section of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>
rocks in the Marathon uplift, but only
one <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a>, the Gaptank, is very fossiliferous.
It contains many fossils including
fusulinids, sponges, corals, bryozoans,
brachiopods, gastropods, pelecypods,
cephalopods, and crinoids.</p>
<p>Certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> strata in the
Llano region are very <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>, and the
material is well preserved. The more
abundant forms are fusulinids, corals,
brachiopods, gastropods, pelecypods, cephalopods,
and crinoids.</p>
<p>Probably the best <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> collecting
areas are to be found in north-central
Texas. Here the thick marine limestones
and shales contain large numbers of well-preserved
invertebrate fossils, and the terrestrial
or shallow marine strata have
yielded an abundance of plant fossils. Invertebrate
fossils are apt to be found along
the banks of streams and gullies and in
railroad and highway cuts. Many of the
limestones bear large numbers of fusulinids
or crinoid stems, and the shales may
contain many corals, brachiopods, and
mollusks. The best collecting will, of
course, be found where the rocks have been
sufficiently weathered.</p>

<p>Typical invertebrate fossils are foraminifera
(principally fusulinids), corals (especially
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Solitary">solitary</a> or &ldquo;horn&rdquo; corals),
brachiopods, bryozoans (the lacy and

pelecypods, gastropods (exhibiting a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a>
of coiling), cephalopods (nautiloids
and goniatites predominate), and crinoids,
which in many areas are found in thick
crinoidal limestones (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). Some typical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> fossils are illustrated in
Plates <a href="#plate14">14</a>, <a href="#plate15">15</a>, <a href="#plate17">17</a>, <a href="#plate18">18</a>, <a href="#plate19">19</a>, <a href="#plate20">20</a>, <a href="#plate21">21</a>, <a href="#plate24">24</a>, <a href="#plate32">32</a>,

<h5 id="c69"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a></h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> rocks are found in widely separated
areas in Texas. The best exposed
section of marine Permian rocks is found
in the Glass Mountains of Brewester
County, and many of these rocks are very
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>. The original shell material of
some of the Permian fossils of this area
has been replaced by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Siliceous">siliceous</a> material
which is very well preserved. These silicified
fossils are removed from the limestone
by solution in acid, and some most remarkable
specimens have been recovered in this
manner (<a href="#plate3">Pl. 3</a>). Brachiopods are the most
common fossils, but corals, bryozoans, and
mollusks have also been recovered.</p>
<p>Extensive <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> exposures occur also
in the central part of the North-Central
Plains region. These rocks were formed
from sediments of both marine and continental
origin and some of them are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>.
The marine rocks contain a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a>
of invertebrate fossils including brachiopods,
pelecypods, gastropods, and ammonoids.
Those rocks representing terrestrial
deposits contain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> remains at
many localities, and numerous amphibians
and primitive reptiles (<a href="#plate40">Pl. 40</a>) have been
collected from them.</p>
<h4 id="c70"><span class="center small"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">MESOZOIC</a> ROCKS</span></h4>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> rocks occur over a wide area

<a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> age. Many of
the Upper and Lower Cretaceous outcrops
are quite <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> and easily accessible

amateur collectors.</p>
<h5 id="c71"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a></h5>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> rocks crop out in parts of the
High Plains, the Glass Mountains of Trans-Pecos
Texas, and parts of Pecos, Crockett,
Upton, Reagan, and Glasscock and other
west Texas counties. These are predominantly
nonmarine rocks consisting of conglomerates,
sandstones, shales, and some
gypsum beds.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> fossils are almost exclusively
vertebrates, although some poorly preserved
plant and invertebrate remains have
been reported. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> vertebrates of the
Texas Triassic include phytosaurs (<a href="#plate42">Pl. 42</a>),
crocodiles, amphibians, and fish.</p>
<h5 id="c72"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a></h5>
<p>In Texas, surface exposures of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a>
rocks are known only from Malone Mountain
in southwestern Hudspeth County. The
rocks there are limestones, shales, sandstones,
and conglomerates. Fossils reported
from that locality include marine and
fresh-water pelecypods, fresh-water gastropods,
and ammonites.</p>
<h5 id="c73"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a></h5>
<p>Rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> age are widely distributed
in Texas and represent one of the
more important <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> systems of the State.
Cretaceous outcrops occur in central Texas,
north Texas, the Edwards Plateau, parts of
the High Plains, the Gulf Coastal Plain,
and Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="#txcret">earlier</a>, the Texas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
has been divided into the Lower
Cretaceous (Comanche <a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a>) and Upper
Cretaceous (Gulf series). These rocks consist
primarily of marls (a type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
clay), shales, chalks, and limestones,
but sands and conglomerates also occur.
Cretaceous rocks occur on the surface of
about 28 percent of Texas, and many of the
larger cities of the State are situated on
Cretaceous strata.</p>
<p>Many of the Gulf and Comanche formations
contain fossils which are of interest
both to amateur and professional paleontologists.
Because of their wide distribution
in and near large population centers, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
outcrops can be conveniently
visited by many amateur <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collectors.
The fossils are usually abundant and varied,
and some are well preserved. Although
numerous kinds of fossils may be collected,
the more common forms are cephalopods,
pelecypods, gastropods, and echinoids.
Some of the more typical Cretaceous fossils
are shown in Plates <a href="#plate16">16</a>, <a href="#plate21">21</a>, <a href="#plate25">25</a>-28, <a href="#plate32">32</a>,
<a href="#plate33">33</a>, <a href="#plate35">35</a>, and <a href="#plate36">36</a>.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> fossils are more commonly
found in shales and chalky limestones.
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">Fossiliferous</a> outcrops of these rocks can
be found along many streams, roads, and
highways of central Texas, north Texas,
and the Edwards Plateau. Outcrops which
have been weathered are more likely to
provide good collecting. In general, collecting
is poor in areas covered with heavy
vegetation or recent stream deposits. Good
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
collecting localities are outcrops which
have a fairly steep slope with a covering of
weathered <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> material and a minimum
of vegetation. One should move slowly
from the base of the slope upward while
searching the ground for any evidence of
fossils, and particular attention should be
given to any small gullies since these often
contain fossils that have been washed out
of upper beds in the exposure.</p>
<h4 id="c74"><span class="center small"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">CENOZOIC</a> ROCKS</span></h4>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> rocks are widespread in Texas

the Gulf Coastal Plain. In addition, there
are exposures of nonmarine Cenozoic strata
in the High Plains, North-Central Plains,
and Trans-Pecos region. There are also
many exposures of Cenozoic igneous rocks
in Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<p>Rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> age occur in more
than one-third of Texas and consist of conglomerates,

<h4 id="c75"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a></h4>
<p>Extensive exposures of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> rocks

<p>Invertebrate fossils are common in certain
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> formations and pelecypods,
gastropods, and corals are the predominant
forms. In general, however, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a>
exposures are of local occurrence and most
of the Tertiary formations are unfossiliferous.
Those Tertiary invertebrates that
are present, however, are often well preserved
and represent many interesting
types (Pls. <a href="#plate16">16</a>, <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <a href="#plate23">23</a>, <a href="#plate29">29</a>, <a href="#plate30">30</a>, <a href="#plate31">31</a>).</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> invertebrate fossils are commonly
found in sands, clays, and marls.
Many of these sands and marls have a
green color which is due to the presence
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Glauconite">glauconite</a> (a green mineral containing
iron and closely related to the micas). At
certain localities on the Gulf Coastal Plain
the glauconite marls and sands of the
Weches and Crockett formations contain
large numbers of well-preserved clams,
snails, and corals. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">Fossiliferous</a> exposures
of Tertiary rocks are sometimes found in
road cuts, but better exposures may be
found along the banks of rivers and creeks.
Certain bluffs along the Brazos, Sabine,
and Trinity rivers are well-known Tertiary
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collecting localities. Many of
these better localities are listed in some of
the Bureau of Economic Geology bulletins
included in the bibliography of this publication

<p>These rocks are distributed along the

<h2 id="c77">MAIN TYPES OF FOSSILS</h2>
<p>The beginning <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> collector is usually amazed by the many different plants and
animals that have left some trace of their existence. In order to understand these
different types of prehistoric life, it is necessary to know something about the
organisms that are living today.</p>
<p>This handbook discusses the more important groups of plants and animals
which have left some sort of paleontological record, and each major group begins
with a discussion of the more simple organisms and continues through the
more advanced forms. Because scientific workers do not always agree on exactly
the same classification, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a> adopted in this handbook contains the latest ideas
of several workers. It is simple enough to understand, yet complete enough to help
one know and classify his fossils. It should be noted that this classification may differ
in some respects from that of certain older paleontological publications. Therefore, it
has seemed advisable to list other names for some of the groups that are discussed.</p>
<p>In some instances, the brief descriptions and illustrations of each group will enable
the collector to make a preliminary identification of his fossils. For more detailed
information about each group, the reader should refer to &ldquo;Books About Fossils&rdquo;
(pp. <a class="pgref" href="#Page_108">108</a>-110).</p>
<p>This part of the handbook begins with a brief summary of the major groups of the
plant kingdom, followed by a discussion of the characteristics and relative paleontological
importance of the various invertebrate animals. Emphasis is placed on the
invertebrates because this type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> is most commonly collected by the amateur.
Finally, there is a general review of the vertebrates.</p>
<h3 id="c78">PLANT FOSSILS</h3>
<p>Plant fossils are usually fragmental and poorly preserved, and this tends to discourage
most amateurs from an active interest in paleobotany. However, in spite
of these problems, much is known of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Evolution">evolution</a> of plants, and plant fossils provide
much information about life of the past. In addition, certain plants are of
considerable value as indicators of ancient climatic conditions, and their remains
have played a large part in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Formation">formation</a> of vast coal deposits.</p>
<h4 id="c79"><span class="center">Classification of the Plant Kingdom</span></h4>
<p>In the following classification only the larger taxonomic groups are discussed.
Notice that the term <i>division</i> has been used in place of the term <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> as used
in the animal kingdom. This usage is now preferred by many botanists and
paleobotanists.</p>
<h5 id="c80"><span class="center small">DIVISION THALLOPHYTA</span></h5>
<p>Thallophytes are simple plants without roots, stems, or leaves. They include the
fungi, algae, and diatoms (<a href="#plate12">Pl. 12</a>). Diatoms are microscopic fossils that are
found in many of the rocks of Texas, and they are quite abundant in Recent sediments
as well. Certain of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> limestones of central Texas contain banded
spherical masses of algae called &ldquo;algal biscuits.&rdquo; Although not particularly useful
fossils, thallophytes have a long geologic history and are known in rocks ranging
from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Precambrian">Precambrian</a> to Recent in age.</p>
<h5 id="c81"><span class="center small">DIVISION BRYOPHYTA</span></h5>
<p>The bryophytes are simple rootless plants and include the mosses and liverworts.
Although more complex, the bryophytes resemble the algae in some respects.
They are uncommon fossils, but undoubted bryophytes (liverworts) have been reported
from rocks as old as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a>.</p>
<h5 id="c82"><span class="center small">DIVISION TRACHEOPHYTA</span></h5>
<p>This division has been divided into four subdivisions, among which are many of
the more common living and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> plants. Such important plants as the ferns, evergreens,
hardwood trees, and the flowering plants are all tracheophytes. Among the
more common and abundant fossil tracheophytes are the ferns, cycads, and <i>Gingko</i>,
in addition to such important &ldquo;coal plants&rdquo; as the scale trees, club mosses, and scouring
rushes (Pls. <a href="#plate12">12</a>, <a href="#plate13">13</a>). The latter commonly occur in many of the world&rsquo;s great
coal deposits, and their remains make up a large part of the coal. Plant fossils of
this type may be collected in the dumps around some of the abandoned coal mines
in north-central Texas and from other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> rocks in north and Trans-Pecos
Texas.</p>

<p>Fairly well-preserved plant remains may also be collected from the Woodbine group
of the Upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> in north Texas, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> wood, most of it silicified, has
been reported from rocks of almost all ages and in almost every section of the
State. In addition, some of the carbonaceous clays and shales of east Texas contain
large assemblages of plant leaves, which in some places are well preserved.</p>
<p>It is also possible to find the fossilized remains of seeds, spores, and pollen. Because
of their small size, these minute remains are not destroyed by the drill bit
and can be brought out of deep wells without being damaged, and for this reason
they are a valuable tool for the micropaleontologist.</p>
<h3 id="c83">ANIMAL FOSSILS</h3>
<p>The fossilized remains of animals are very common in
many of the sedimentary rocks of Texas.
These remains are of many different kinds and represent the fossils of
such diverse organisms as the shell of a tiny one-celled animal or the bones or tusk
of a huge elephant. The fossils most commonly found, however, are the remains of
invertebrate animals such as clams, snails, and corals, and it is this type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> that
attracts the interest of most amateur collectors.</p>
<p>It is not always easy to tell whether certain organisms are plants or animals, and
because of this some scientists have suggested that these &ldquo;in-betweens&rdquo; be placed
in a separate kingdom&mdash;the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Protista">Protista</a>. The protistans are primarily <a class="gloss" href="#g_Unicellular">unicellular</a> organisms
and are represented by such forms as bacteria, algae, diatoms, and the protozoans
(see <a href="#c84">below</a>). But in this publication, only the plant and animal kingdoms are
recognized.</p>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c84"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Protozoa</h4>
<p>This <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> is composed of simple one-celled animals many of which have no shell
or external body covering. Some, however, have external hard parts that can become
fossilized, and these forms are quite useful microfossils.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c85">CLASS SARCODINA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>This class contains a group of one-celled animals which
may secrete an <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> (external protective covering) of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitin">chitin</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>, or calcium
carbonate. Included in this class are foraminiferans (commonly called forams)
and radiolarians.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c86">Order Foraminifera.&mdash;</h6>
<p>Members of this order secrete tiny chambered shells which are very useful microfossils. The
forams are predominantly marine organisms and have shells composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitin">chitin</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>, or calcium carbonate. In addition, some forms construct a shell of sand grains
or some other material which is cemented together by a sticky substance that is
secreted by the animal.</p>
<p>Forams are very abundant in the rocks of Texas and particularly so in rocks of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> age. The most numerous and easily observed <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>
foraminiferans are the fusulinids (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>a), and their small spindle-shaped remains are
very abundant in many of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> limestones of north-central and
Trans-Pecos Texas. Some typical Texas forams are illustrated in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c87">Order Radiolaria.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The radiolarians (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>) have delicate spine-covered
shells composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>, and their remains are very abundant in certain recent
marine sediments. They may also be found as fossils and have been reported
from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> rocks in
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
Trans-Pecos Texas, and probable radiolarians have been reported from still
younger beds.</p>

</div>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c88"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Porifera</h4>
<p>These are sponges and are the simplest of the many-celled animals. Living sponges
secrete a skeleton which may be composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitin">chitin</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silica">silica</a>, or calcium carbonate.
These substances are commonly found in the form of spicules&mdash;tiny hard parts that
are used to help support the soft tissues of the animal. These spicules take on a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a>
of shapes (<a href="#plate14">Pl. 14</a>) and are occasionally found as microfossils in some marine
sediments.</p>
<p>Although sponges are not particularly common fossils, their remains occur in
some parts of the State. Sponges have been collected from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>
formations of north and Trans-Pecos Texas, and their spicules have been reported
from well cuttings.</p>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c89"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Coelenterata</h4>
<p>The coelenterates are multicelled animals which, though more complex than
the sponges, are rather primitive animals. The living animal is characterized by a
sac-like body cavity, a definite mouth, and tentacles which bear stinging cells. Some
forms, for example, the jellyfishes, have an umbrella-shaped body and are single
free-moving organisms. Others, like the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a> corals, are composed of many
individuals living together in a colony.</p>
<p>Most zoologists and paleontologists recognize three classes of coelenterates:
(1) the Hydrozoa, containing the small animals known as hydroids, (2) the
Scyphozoa, which includes the jellyfish, and (3) the Anthozoa, which includes the
corals and sea anemones. Because of their extreme fragility and lack of hard parts,
hydrozoans and scyphozoans are not commonly found as fossils. They do, however,
have a long geologic history and may be preserved when unusual conditions of
fossilization occur. The anthozoans, especially the corals, are by far the most
important class geologically, and these forms have left a very good paleontological
record.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c90">CLASS ANTHOZOA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>This class is composed of a group of exclusively marine
organisms and includes the corals and sea anemones. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coral">coral</a> animal, or <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Polyp">polyp</a></i>,
secretes a cup-shaped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> (limy) <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>. This skeleton, called a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Corallite">corallite</a></i>,
is usually divided by radial partitions called <i>septa</i>. The polyp lives in the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a></i>,
which is the central bowl-shaped depression in the top of the corallite (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>a).</p>
<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Solitary">Solitary</a></i> corals form an individual <a class="gloss" href="#g_Corallite">corallite</a> for each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Polyp">polyp</a>, and because of their
shape these may be given such names as &ldquo;horn corals&rdquo; (<i>Lophophyllidium</i>, <a href="#plate15">Pl. 15</a>)
or &ldquo;button corals&rdquo; (<i>Micrabacia</i>, <a href="#plate16">Pl. 16</a>). <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">Colonial</a></i> or <i>compound</i> corals (<a href="#plate15">Pl. 15</a>) live
together in colonies, which are formed of many individual skeletons attached to
each other (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>b), and the compound
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
mass of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Coral">coral</a> skeletons formed in this manner is called a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Corallum">corallum</a></i>. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> corals

of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a>.</p>

<p>The class Anthozoa has been divided into several subclasses, but only one, the
Zoantharia, is of paleontological importance.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c91">Subclass Zoantharia.&mdash;</h5>
<p>Most corals and all sea anemones belong to this subclass.
Zoantharians are either <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Solitary">solitary</a> and, because most of them possess
a hard preservable <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, they are the most important group of anthozoans
geologically. The various orders of the subclass Zoantharia are discussed below.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c92">Order Rugosa.&mdash;</h6>
<p>These are corals in which the septa are arranged in cycles
of four. Both <a class="gloss" href="#g_Solitary">solitary</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a> forms occur, and they are found only in rocks of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> age. Rugose corals are abundant in many of the Paleozoic formations of
Texas, and two of the more typical forms (<i>Lophophyllidium</i> and <i>Caninia</i>) are
illustrated in <a href="#plate15">Plate 15</a>. Members of this order have been placed in the subclass
Tetracoralla of older classifications.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c93">Order Scleractinia.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The scleractinians are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Solitary">solitary</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a> corals in
which the septa grow in multiples of six, and they are the most important and
abundant of the modern corals. These corals were the dominant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Reef">reef</a> builders of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> seas, and their remains are common in many of the marine
formations of the State. <a href="#plate16">Plate 16</a> illustrates some typical scleractinian corals from the
rocks of Texas. This order has also been referred to as subclass Hexacoralla, and
its members have been called hexacorals.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c94">Order Tabulata.&mdash;</h6>
<p>These are corals that are now extinct but are known
from fossils in both <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> rocks. Tabulate corals are
characterized by horizontal partitions called <i>tabulae</i>, and septa are absent or
poorly developed. The tabulates were the most abundant reef-building corals during
Paleozoic time and are well known as fossils. Because of certain similarities with
other anthozoans, some paleontologists have treated the Tabulata as a distinct subclass
rather than as an order of the Zoantharia.</p>
<p>Tabulate corals are not uncommon in many of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> rocks of Texas, and
two of these (<i>Cladochonus</i> and <i>Striatopora</i>) are illustrated in <a href="#plate15">Plate 15</a>.</p>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c95"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Bryozoa</h4>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

</div>
<p>Bryozoans are <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a> animals that are often referred to as &ldquo;sea mats.&rdquo; They have
been called this because they are commonly found matted on shells, rocks, fossils,
and other objects. The living animal is quite small, has a tentacle-bearing ridge
surrounding the mouth, and secretes a tiny cup-like <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">chitinous</a> material. These little chambers, known as <i>zooecia</i> (or <i>autopores</i>),
are seen as small pits on the surface of the bryozoan colony (<i>Rhombopora</i>,
<a href="#plate17">Pl. 17</a>). The zooecia grow together to form the bryozoan colony, and some <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
colonies grow to be as much as 2 feet across. Such colonies may be spiral
(<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>b), branching, or lace-like (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>a), and the latter two types are very
common in many of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> strata of Texas. Undoubted bryozoan fossils have
been recorded in rocks of Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> age, but questionable <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a>
forms have also been reported. Bryozoans are abundant in the seas of today, but
only a few forms inhabit fresh waters.</p>

<p>In Texas one may expect to find bryozoan
remains in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> rocks
of north-central and Trans-Pecos Texas
where they are abundant in certain of
the marine shales and limestones. Bryozoans
may also be collected from some
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> beds, but their
remains are small and fragmental and
they are easily overlooked. Bryozoans
have also been found matted on the shells
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> mollusks and other invertebrates.</p>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c96"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Brachiopoda</h4>
<p>The brachiopods are a large group of
exclusively marine organisms with shells
composed of two pieces called <i>valves</i> (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>).
These valves are usually composed of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phosphatic">phosphatic</a> material and enclose
and protect the soft parts of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopod</a> animal. The soft parts are composed
of muscles, the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mantle">mantle</a></i> (which secretes
the valves), digestive, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Respiration">respiration</a>,
reproductive, and excretory organs, and
the tentacle-bearing <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Lophophore">lophophore</a></i>.</p>
<p>In adult life the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Brachiopod">brachiopod</a> is attached
to the sea bottom by means of a fleshy
stalk called the <i>pedicle</i> (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>), and this
is usually extruded through a hole (the
<i>pedicle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Foramen">foramen</a></i>) which is located in the
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Ventral">ventral</a></i> or <i>pedicle</i> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Valve">valve</a>. The upturned area
which is usually present on the pedicle valve is called
the <i>beak</i>. The other valve,
known as the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Dorsal">dorsal</a></i> or <i>brachial</i> valve, is
usually the smaller of the two (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>b).
The two valves are opened by means of
muscles, and since death results in relaxation
of these muscles, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> brachiopods
are typically found with valves closed.</p>
<p>Brachiopods vary greatly in size and
shape and exhibit a wide <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a> of ornamentation,
such as spines, ribs, nodes, and
other structures. They are abundant fossils
in many of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> rocks of Texas
but are relatively rare in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> formations.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> has been divided into two
subclasses, the Inarticulata and the Articulata.
This classification is based upon the
nature of the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_HingeLine">hinge-line</a></i>&mdash;the edge of the
shell where the two valves articulate.</p>

<h5 class="class" id="c97">CLASS INARTICULATA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The members
of this class are rather primitive and
have a long geologic history. These brachiopods
have valves which are not provided
with hinge teeth, the valves being
held together by muscles, and a <a class="gloss" href="#g_HingeLine">hinge-line</a>
is lacking (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>). Most inarticulate brachiopods
are circular or tongue-like in
shape and commonly composed of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">chitinous</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phosphatic">phosphatic</a> material. Inarticulate
brachiopods range from Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a>

<p>Articulate
brachiopods have a well-defined <a class="gloss" href="#g_HingeLine">hinge-line</a>
(<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>a). One <a class="gloss" href="#g_Valve">valve</a> has well-developed

<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> Mollusca encompasses a
large group of aquatic (water-dwelling)
and terrestrial (land-dwelling) invertebrates
which includes such familiar forms
as the snails, clams, oysters, squids, and
octopuses. Most mollusks possess a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
shell that serves as an <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, and
these hard parts are well adapted for preservation
as fossils. However, some mollusks
(the slugs) have no shells, and others
(the squids) have an internal calcareous
shell. Because of their relative abundance
and great <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a>, mollusks are particularly
useful fossils. Moreover, the remains
of certain mollusks, such as the oysters, are
important <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rock">rock</a> builders.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> Mollusca has been divided
into five classes:</p>
<p class="revind2">1. <i>Amphineura</i>&mdash;the chitons or sea-mice; shell composed of eight valves

<p class="revind2">2. <i>Scaphopoda</i>&mdash;the tusk-shells; shell composed of a single tusk-like <a class="gloss" href="#g_Valve">valve</a>;

<p class="revind2">3. <i>Gastropoda</i>&mdash;the snails and slugs; slugs are without shells, snails have

<p>Of these five classes, only the Gastropoda,
Pelecypoda, and Cephalopoda are
discussed herein.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c100">CLASS GASTROPODA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The typical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Gastropod">gastropod</a> has a spirally coiled, single-valved,
unchambered shell. This shell encloses
a soft body possessing a well-defined
head with a pair of eyes and one or two
pairs of tentacles. Most gastropods have
gills and live in shallow marine waters, but
some inhabit fresh water. Others are land-dwelling
forms and breathe by means of
lungs.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Gastropod">Gastropod</a> shells, both Recent and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>,
exhibit a great <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a> of size, shape, and
ornamentation. Such shells may be cone-shaped,
spirally coiled, flat, turreted, or
cylindrical. The shell is commonly wound
in a spiral around a central axial pillar
(the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Columella">columella</a></i>). The closed pointed end of
the shell is called the <i>apex</i>, and each turn
of the shell is called a <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Whorl">whorl</a></i> (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>). The
last-formed and largest whorl is called the
<i>body whorl</i>, and this whorl contains the
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Aperture">aperture</a></i>&mdash;the opening of the shell. The
combined whorls exclusive of the body
whorl are known as the <i>spire</i>. The inner
and outer margins of the aperture are
designated the <i>inner lip</i> and the <i>outer lip</i>,
respectively. In some snails the aperture
is closed by means of the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Operculum">operculum</a></i>&mdash;a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> or horny plate attached to
the foot of the animal. This plate effectively
seals the aperture when the animal is
withdrawn into its shell. Some gastropods
have shells that are loosely coiled, and in
these forms the columella is absent. If the
whorls of such shells are not in contact on
the inner surface, this leaves an open space
which is called the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Umbilicus">umbilicus</a></i> (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>a).
The umbilicus is commonly seen as an
opening in the base of the gastropod shell,
but in some forms the umbilical opening
may be partially or completely covered by
a thick growth of shell called the <i>callus</i>.</p>
<p>Many gastropods, particularly those of
the Texas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, are commonly preserved
as internal or external molds. This
type of preservation occurs after the death
of the animal, and the decomposition of the
soft parts enables the shell to become filled
with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Sediment">sediment</a>. This filling later becomes
solidified, and the outer shell may eventually
be removed by weathering or solution.
This type of internal mold is called a <i>steinkern</i>
and normally does not reflect any external
shell characteristics (<a href="#plate2">Pl. 2</a>). In some
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> formations,
however, gastropods may be collected
with the original shell in an excellent
state of preservation.</p>
<p>Plates <a href="#plate20">20</a>-23 illustrate some typical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> gastropods.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c101">CLASS PELECYPODA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The pelecypods
possess a shell composed of two <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
valves (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>) which enclose the
soft parts of the animal. Members of this
class live exclusively in an aquatic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>
and are most abundant in marine environments.
Most pelecypods are slow-moving
bottom-dwelling forms, but some, like the
oysters, are attached. Still others, for example,
the scallop or <i>Pecten</i>, are swimmers.
The Pelecypoda include such familiar saltwater
forms as the clams and oysters, as
well as the common fresh-water mussel.
Pelecypods range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to Recent
in age but are more abundant in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> rocks.</p>
<p>The living animal is aquatic, with
well-developed soft parts and a muscular,
commonly hatchet-shaped <i>foot</i>. The soft
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mantle">mantle</a></i> encloses the body and secretes the
shell, and in some pelecypods part of the
mantle is developed into the <i>incurrent</i> and
<i>excurrent</i> siphons. The incurrent siphons
bring fresh water and food into the <i>mantle
cavity</i>, and waste products are passed out
through the excurrent siphons. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Respiration">Respiration</a>
is by means of gills within the mantle
cavity.</p>
<p>The typical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pelecypod">pelecypod</a> valves are of
equal size and form, but some, such as the
scallops and oysters, have two valves of
unequal size and shape. The valves are
hinged and held together by a tough elastic
ligament which runs along the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Dorsal">dorsal</a></i> (top)
side of the shell. In addition to the ligament,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
most forms have <i>teeth</i> and <i>sockets</i>
which are located along the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_HingeLine">hinge-line</a></i>. The
teeth in one <a class="gloss" href="#g_Valve">valve</a> articulate with the sockets
in the opposite valve, and this arrangement
gives strength to the hinge.</p>

<p>The outline of the shell may vary greatly,
but most pelecypods are typically clam-like.
However, certain forms are round,
others are long and narrow, and some have
wing-like structures. Most pelecypods have
a beak which represents the oldest part of
the shell. The <i>beak</i> is commonly located on
the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Anterior">anterior</a></i> (front) end of the shell, and
the end of the shell opposite this is designated
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Posterior">posterior</a></i> (the rear). The hinge and
ligament are located dorsally (along the
top), and the lower margin of the shell
where the valves open is called <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Ventral">ventral</a></i>
(<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>a).</p>

<p>The inner surface of the shell has certain
markings which, along with the shell
form and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dentition">dentition</a> (the nature and arrangement
of the teeth and sockets), are
important in classification. Muscle scars
are present on the inside of most valves;
the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Anterior">anterior</a> muscle scars</i> are located near
the front of the shell, and the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Posterior">posterior</a>
muscle scars</i> are situated near the rear
of the shell. These scars mark the place of
attachment of muscles which were used to
close the shell and aid in locomotion. Along
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ventral">ventral</a> margin of some shells there is
a line or scar which extends from the
anterior muscle scar to the posterior
muscle scar. This is known as the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Mantle">mantle</a>
line</i> or <i>pallial line</i> and marks the place of
attachment of the <i>mantle</i>&mdash;a soft membranous
layer that enclosed the body of the
animal. In some pelecypods the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dorsal">dorsal</a>
margin of one <a class="gloss" href="#g_Valve">valve</a> bears a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> of <i>hinge teeth</i> which articulate with a similar set of
sockets on the other valve (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>b). In
addition to hinge teeth, certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Species">species</a>
have <i>cardinal teeth</i> which are located
below and in front of the hinge teeth.</p>
<p>The exterior of most shells is marked by
a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Concentric">concentric</a> growth lines</i> (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>a)
which mark points of periodic addition
of shell material. The external surface
of many shells is also marked by various
types of ornamentation, such as ribs,
nodes, spines, and grooves.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> collectors commonly find only one
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Valve">valve</a> of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pelecypod">pelecypod</a> shell. This is because
the shell normally opens when the
animal dies, and the valves may easily
become separated. Fossil pelecypods are
also commonly preserved as external and
internal molds, and these are found in
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> strata of almost all ages.
Some pelecypods of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> age are found
with original shell material that appears
to have undergone very little change. Fossil
pelecypods are abundant and varied in
Texas and are found in most of the
fossiliferous formations of the Pennsylvanian,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> systems
(Pls. <a href="#plate24">24</a>-31).</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c102">CLASS CEPHALOPODA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These are
marine mollusks with or without chambered
or solid shells which may be internal
or external. The living animal possesses a
well-developed head with eyes, horny jaws,
and many tentacles fused with the foot.
Cephalopods are the most advanced of all
mollusks and include the squid, octopus,
pearly nautilus, and the extinct ammonoids.
Members of this class range
from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to Recent in age but were
much more abundant in ancient seas than
they are today. Their remains constitute
a very useful group of fossils, particularly
in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> rocks.</p>
<p>Most paleontologists have divided the
Cephalopoda into three subclasses, the
Nautiloidea, Ammonoidea, and the Coleoidea
(known also as subclass Dibranchiata
and subclass Decapoda); each of
these is discussed below.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c103">Subclass Nautiloidea.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The nautiloids
are cephalopods with external
chambered shells in which the <i>septa</i>
(dividing partitions) are simple and have
smooth edges. This subclass is represented
by a single living genus, <i>Nautilus</i>, and a
large number of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> forms.</p>
<p>In the living <i>Nautilus</i> the shell is composed
of calcium carbonate and is coiled
in a flat spiral (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). The interior of
the shell is divided into a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> of
<i>chambers</i> by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> partitions called
<i>septa</i>. The point where each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Septum">septum</a> joins
the inner surface of the shell is known as
the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Suture">suture</a></i>. These <i>suture lines</i> (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>a)
are not visible from the outside unless the
outer shell has been removed, but they are
visible on the internal molds of many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
cephalopods and are of great importance in
nautiloid and ammonoid classification.
Nautiloids have very simple smoothly
curved suture patterns, but ammonoids
are characterized by more complex and
wrinkled sutures (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>d).</p>
<p>Although the shell of the only type of
living nautiloid is coiled, many of the early
forms had straight cone-shaped shells
(<i>Orthoceras</i>, <a href="#plate32">Pl. 32</a>), and these are common
in some of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> formations
of Texas. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> coiled nautiloids may
be collected in certain of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> strata of the State, but their
remains are not common. <i>Cymatoceras</i>
(<a href="#plate32">Pl. 32</a>) is a coiled fossil nautiloid from
the Cretaceous of north Texas.</p>

have an external partitioned shell which
is straight, curved, or spirally coiled
(<a href="#plate33">Pl. 33</a>). This group of cephalopods first

are known from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to the
Recent (<a href="#plate34">Pl. 34</a>). Modern representatives
of this group include the crabs, shrimp,
crayfish, insects, and spiders. Arthropods
vary greatly in size and shape and are
among the most abundant of all animals.
They have become successfully adapted to
a wide <a class="gloss" href="#g_Variety">variety</a> of environments and live
on land, in water, and in the air. The
typical arthropod has a segmented body
which is usually covered by a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">chitinous</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> which, in some forms, contains
additions of calcium carbonate. They are
highly specialized and well-developed animals
in which locomotion is by means of
paired jointed appendages.</p>
<p>Although the arthropods are of great
importance in nature today, only a few
groups are of importance to the paleontologist.
Only two of these, the trilobites
and the ostracodes, are discussed herein.</p>
<h4 class="subphylum" id="c109">Subphylum Trilobitomorpha</h4>
<p>The members of this subphylum are
extinct arthropods which were most
abundant during early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> time.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c110">CLASS TRILOBITA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The trilobites
are a group of exclusively marine arthropods
which derive their name from the
typical three-lobed appearance of their
bodies (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>a). The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Trilobite">trilobite</a> body is
divided into a <i>central</i> or <i>axial</i> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lobe">lobe</a> and
two <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Lateral">lateral</a></i> lobes. The body of the animal
was encased in a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">chitinous</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>.
The top part of this exterior covering, the
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Carapace">carapace</a></i>, is very thick, and it is this part
of the trilobite that is usually preserved.</p>

<p>The body is also divided into three
parts from front to back. Beginning at the
front of the animal these divisions are the
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cephalon">cephalon</a></i> or head, the <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Thorax">thorax</a></i> or abdomen,
and the <i>pygidium</i> or tail (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>a). The
body segments of the thorax were arranged
in such a manner as to permit the
animal to roll up into a ball, and many
trilobites are found in this position
(<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>b).</p>
<p>Trilobites first appeared in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a>
and were extinct by the end of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>. They occur sparingly in certain
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> rocks of Texas and when
found are likely to be fragmental and in
a poor state of preservation.</p>
<h4 class="subphylum" id="c111">Subphylum Crustacea</h4>
<p>The crustaceans are the crabs, shrimp,
crayfish, and ostracodes. Although not
abundant, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> crabs have been described
from certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>
formations of the State (<i>Notopocorystes</i>,
<a href="#plate34">Pl. 34</a>). However, the most useful and
abundant crustacean fossils are the members
of the class Ostracoda.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c112">CLASS OSTRACODA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The ostracodes
are small, bivalved, aquatic crustaceans
which have the external appearance
of small clams (<a href="#plate34">Pl. 34</a>). The remains of
these tiny animals are so small that they
are best studied under a low-power microscope,
and because of their small size they
are particularly useful to the micropaleontologist.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a> ostracodes range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a>
to Recent in age and have been recorded
in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>

abundant in certain of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> marine formations of the
State.</p>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c113"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Echinodermata</h4>
<p>The echinoderms are a large group of
exclusively marine animals, most of which
exhibit a marked five-fold <a class="gloss" href="#g_RadialSymmetry">radial symmetry</a>
(Pls. <a href="#plate35">35</a>, <a href="#plate36">36</a>). Living echinoderms
have well-developed nervous and digestive
systems, a distinct body cavity, and are a
relatively complex group of organisms.</p>
<p>The typical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Echinoderm">echinoderm</a> has a skeleton
composed of numerous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> plates
which are intricately fitted together and
covered by a leathery outer skin (the
<i>integument</i>). The echinoderm body often
exhibits a typical star-shaped form, but
some types may be heart-shaped, biscuit-shaped,
or cucumber-shaped.</p>
<p>Members of this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> range from
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to Recent in age and are
abundant as fossils in many of the marine
formations of Texas.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> Echinodermata has been
divided into two subphyla, the Pelmatozoa
(those forms that were attached to sea
floor by a stem or a stalk) and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
Eleutherozoa (the stemless unattached
echinoderms).</p>
<h4 class="subphylum" id="c114">Subphylum Pelmatozoa</h4>
<p>These are echinoderms which are more
or less permanently attached to the bottom
of the sea by means of a stalk which is
composed of slightly movable, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>,
disk-like segments (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>).</p>
<p>Pelmatozoans range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to
Recent in age, and their fossilized remains
are particularly abundant in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>
rocks. The subphylum has been divided
into several classes, but only three of these,
the Cystoidea, Blastoidea, and Crinoidea,
are discussed here. With the exception of
the Crinoidea, all of the attached echinoderms
are extinct.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c115">CLASS CYSTOIDEA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These are primitive
attached echinoderms which were relatively
common in early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> time.
The typical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cystoid">cystoid</a> has a somewhat globular
or sac-like <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a></i> (the main body skeleton)
composed of numerous, irregularly
arranged, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> plates (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>b). The
plates composing the calyx are usually perforated
by pores or slits which were probably
used in excretion or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Respiration">respiration</a>. The
calyx was attached to the sea bottom by a
short stem.</p>
<p>Cystoids range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a>
in age and were especially abundant
during <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silurian">Silurian</a> time.
Their remains are rare or absent in the
rocks of Texas.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="class" id="c116">CLASS BLASTOIDEA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The blastoids
are extinct short-stemmed echinoderms
with a small, symmetrical, bud-like <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a>.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Blastoid">blastoid</a> calyx is composed of 13 <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
plates arranged in a typical five-sided
pattern (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>a). The <i>mouth</i> is
located in the center of the calyx and is
surrounded by five openings called <i>spiracles</i>.
Five distinct <i>ambulacral</i> or <i>food
grooves</i> radiate outward from the mouth.</p>
<p>Blastoids range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>
in age and were especially abundant
during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>. No blastoids
have been reported from any of the
rocks of Texas.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c117">CLASS CRINOIDEA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The crinoids
are commonly called <i>sea-lilies</i> because of
their flower-like appearance. The <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a></i> is
composed of symmetrically arranged <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
plates, and most crinoids have a
long stem. Other crinoids are free-swimming
in the adult stage and are attached
only during the earlier phases of their development.</p>
<p>The crinoid <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a> is typically cup-shaped
(<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>) and five grooves radiate out from
its center. These grooves continue outward
along the complexly segmented arms and
are used as channels to convey food to the
mouth.</p>

<p>The crinoid stem is attached to the base
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a> and serves for purposes of support
and attachment. This stem consists of
a relatively long flexible stalk composed
of numerous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> disk-shaped segments
called <i>columnals</i> (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>; <a href="#plate35">Pl. 35</a>),
each of which contains a round or star-shaped
opening in its center. Many crinoids
have very long stalks (some are as much as
50 feet in length), and when the animal
dies the columnals become separated and
are scattered about on the ocean floor.
Many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> limestones contain such
great numbers of crinoid columnals that
they are referred to as <i>crinoidal limestones</i>
(<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). Crinoidal limestones occur in
some of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>
formations of central Texas and in
the Pennsylvanian of north-central and
Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<p>The stalk is attached to the sea floor or
some other object by means of a root <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a>
called the <i>holdfast</i> (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>). This
structure commonly branches out into the
surrounding sediments, and in this manner
the crinoid animal is firmly anchored to
the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Crinoids, like most echinoderms, are
gregarious animals&mdash;that is, they commonly
live together in large numbers, and
for this reason great numbers of crinoid
remains are commonly found concentrated
in relatively small local areas. Most <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
crinoids are found as stem fragments because
the more fragile <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calyx">calyx</a> and root <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a>
are less likely to be preserved.</p>
<p>The earliest known crinoids have been
found in rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> age, and their
remains are particularly abundant in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>
rocks. Crinoids are living today but
most of them are stemless free-swimming
forms called &ldquo;feather stars,&rdquo; much less
abundant than their Paleozoic ancestors.</p>
<h4 class="subphylum" id="c118">Subphylum Eleutherozoa</h4>
<p>The eleutherozoans are free-swimming,
bottom-dwelling, echinoderms which have
been divided into two classes. The class
Asterozoa (star-shaped echinoderms) contains
the subclasses Asteroidea (the starfishes)
and the Ophiuroidea (the brittle
stars). Although they are known as fossils,
neither of these groups is of paleontological
importance. The class Echinozoa (echinoderms
without laterally directed arm-like
extensions) contains the subclasses
Echinoidea (the sea urchins and sand dollars)
and Holothuroidea (the sea cucumbers).
Of these two subclasses, only the
Echinoidea are useful fossils.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c119">CLASS ASTEROZOA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These are typical
star-shaped free-moving echinoderms in
which the body is divided into a central
disk and radiating arms.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c120">Subclass Asteroidea.&mdash;</h5>
<p>This class contains
the starfishes which, although not
common fossils, illustrate well the typical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Echinoderm">echinoderm</a> characteristics (<a href="#plate35">Pl. 35</a>). <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">Fossil</a>
starfishes have been found sparingly in
certain formations in Texas, but well-preserved
specimens are quite rare. However,
excellently preserved starfishes have
been found in slabs of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> limestones
from central and north-central
Texas.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c121">Subclass Ophiuroidea.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The ophiuroids
are echinoderms with a well-defined
central disk and five long, slender, whip-like
arms. They have been called brittle
stars because of their ability to shed their
arms when they are disturbed. Their long,
slender, snake-like arms have also resulted
in their being called serpent stars. Ophiuroids
range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> to Recent in
age, but because of the delicate nature of
their bodies they are seldom found as fossils.
Ophiuroid remains have been found in
certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> rocks of
Texas, but they consist largely of small segments
of the arms or body fragments.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c122">CLASS ECHINOZOA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The echinozoans
are a group of unattached echinoderms
whose bodies consist of numerous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
plates and spines, but they do not
possess the radiating arm-like extensions
which characterize the asterozoans.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c123">Subclass Echinoidea.&mdash;</h5>
<p>Echinoids are
free-moving echinoderms with disk-shaped,
heart-shaped, biscuit-shaped, or globular
exoskeletons (<a href="#plate36">Pl. 36</a>). Modern representatives
of this group include the familiar
sea urchins, heart urchins, and the sand
dollars.</p>

of many intricately fitting <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a>
plates (<a href="#plate36">Pl. 36</a>) which enclose the
animal&rsquo;s soft parts. The exterior of the test
is typically covered with large numbers of
movable spines (<a href="#plate36">Pl. 36</a>) which vary
greatly in size. These spines are of some
aid in locomotion, support the skeleton of
the animal, and provide a measure of protection
from enemies.</p>
<p>The oldest known echinoids have been
recorded from rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> age, but
it was not until the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> that the group
began to flourish. They were especially
abundant during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and have
been abundant and varied from that time until the present.</p>
<p>Echinoids are particularly numerous in
many of the Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> formations
of Texas where they are commonly found
in an excellent state of preservation. Heart
urchins and biscuit urchins may be found
in large numbers in many areas of the
State, and especially in areas where there
are good exposures of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossiliferous">fossiliferous</a> Lower
Cretaceous rocks.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c124">Subclass Holothuroidea.&mdash;</h5>
<p>Members
of this class, commonly called <i>sea cucumbers</i>,
have a rather elongate, sac-like,
cucumber-shaped body and bear little resemblance
to other members of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a>
Echinodermata. The sea cucumbers do not
have a well-defined skeleton; rather the
body is supported by many small, disconnected,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Calcareous">calcareous</a> plates or rods called
<i>ossicles</i> or <i>sclerites</i> (<a href="#plate35">Pl. 35</a>). These minute
structures are embedded in the leathery
skin which covers the body of the sea cucumber
and may be preserved as fossils.
Such remains are locally abundant in certain
formations in Texas, but because of
their small size, scattered occurrence, and
problems in classification, this group is of
little use to most paleontologists.</p>
<p>Holothuroid body impressions have been
reported from the Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a>, and
sclerites from rocks as old as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a>.</p>
<h4 class="phylum" id="c125"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">Phylum</a> Chordata</h4>
<p>The chordates are the most advanced of
all animals and are characterized by the
presence of a well-developed nervous <a class="gloss" href="#g_System">system</a>
and a body supported by a bony or
cartilaginous <i>notochord</i> and/or <i>spinal
column</i>. In the higher chordates (the vertebrates)
the notochord is normally replaced
by bone, but in the lower chordates (for
example, the graptolites) it remains in a
cartilaginous condition.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a> Chordata contains only two
subphyla of paleontological significance.
These are the subphylum Hemichordata,
composed of primitive chordates (including
the graptolites which are important
fossils), and the Vertebrata, which includes
all animals with backbones.</p>
<h4 class="subphylum" id="c126">Subphylum Hemichordata</h4>
<p>The hemichordates are characterized by
a well-defined notochord which runs the
length of the body, but they do not possess
a true backbone. Only one class, the Graptolithina,
is of paleontological importance.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c127">CLASS GRAPTOLITHINA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The
graptolites are a group of extinct <a class="gloss" href="#g_Colonial">colonial</a>
animals which were very abundant during
early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> time. They are characterized
by a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chitinous">chitinous</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> consisting
of rows of cups or tubes which housed the
living animal. These cups are attached to
single or branching stalks (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>) which
in some forms were attached to sea weeds,
rocks, or other foreign objects where they
led a fixed existence. The stalks of the unattached
graptolites grew on floats (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>a)
and these floating forms attained
wide geographic distribution. It is also possible
that some of the attached forms were
fixed to floating objects, such as sea weed,
and thus were distributed in this manner.</p>
<p>Previous classifications have recognized
the graptolites as members of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phylum">phylum</a>
Coelenterata. As coelenterates they were
assigned, at various times, to the classes
Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, and Graptozoa. In
addition, they were also classified as
bryozoans by certain of the early paleontologists.
This publication, in keeping with
recent changes in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Taxonomy">taxonomy</a>, considers
graptolites to be an extinct group of
hemichordates. This classification is
based upon research in which uncompressed
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
graptolites were etched out of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Chert">chert</a> and studied in great detail. Information
derived from these relatively undistorted
specimens indicates a much higher
degree of body organization than was
previously suspected, and as a result of
these studies most paleontologists now consider
graptolites to be some form of
primitive chordate.</p>

residue; their remains may be locally
abundant along the bedding planes of certain
black or dark gray shales.</p>
<p>Graptolites are known from rocks that
range from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippian">Mississippian</a> in
age, and they are among the most important
guide fossils for <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Silurian">Silurian</a> rocks.</p>
<p>Graptolites have been reported from
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cambrian">Cambrian</a> rocks in central Texas and from
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> of west Texas (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>).
The most abundant of these occur in certain
Ordovician rocks in the Trans-Pecos
area where they are common fossils in
certain formations.</p>
<h4 class="subphylum" id="c128">Subphylum Vertebrata</h4>
<p>The vertebrates are the most advanced
of all chordates. They are characterized by
a skull and a bony or cartilaginous <i>internal
skeleton</i>, with a <i>vertebral column</i> of bone
or cartilage. This subphylum is commonly
divided into two superclasses, the Pisces
(the fishes and their relatives) and the
Tetrapoda (the four-footed animals).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most amateur
collectors collect very few <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> remains,
and for this reason this group is
not discussed in detail. However, the more
important vertebrate classes are briefly reviewed
to enable the reader to have some
understanding of this important group of
animals. This part of the handbook will
also serve as an introduction to some of the
interesting and unusual, but now extinct,
animals that have inhabited Texas in the
geologic past. Among these animals are
giant fishes, primitive amphibians, and
many different types of dinosaurs. Included
also are such unusual mammals as
the giant ground sloths, saber-tooth cats,
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
mammoths, and mastodons, all of which
are now extinct. The remains of these, and
many other interesting extinct vertebrates,
may be seen in the geological collections
of the Texas Memorial Museum at
Austin. Many of these displays are accompanied
by drawings which depict the
scientific restoration of the animal&rsquo;s soft
parts and show how the animal may have
appeared in life.</p>
<h5 class="supclass" id="c129">Superclass Pisces</h5>
<p>The members of this superclass are commonly
called fishes and are the simplest
and most numerous of all vertebrates.
They are aquatic, free-moving, cold-blooded
(their blood maintains the temperature
of the surrounding water), and
breathe primarily by means of gills. However,
some forms (the lungfishes) breathe
by means of a lung developed from the
air-bladder.</p>
<p>The most recent fish classification recognizes
four major classes, the Agnatha
(primitive jawless fishes), the Placodermi
(armored fishes with primitive jaws), the
Chondrichthyes (sharks and related forms
with cartilaginous internal skeletons), and
the Osteichthyes (true bony fishes).</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c130">CLASS AGNATHA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>Fishes belonging
to this class are primitive, jawless, and
represented by the living lampreys and
hagfishes. The first agnathans appeared in
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ordovician">Ordovician</a> and were armored by a
bony covering on the front part of their
bodies. These primitive fishes, called <i>ostracoderms</i>,
are the earliest recorded fishes
and, in addition, appear to be the first
known <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> animals. The ostracoderms
first appeared in late Ordovician
time, increased in numbers in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Silurian">Silurian</a>,
and were extinct by the end of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a>.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c131">CLASS PLACODERMI.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These are
primitive jaw-bearing fishes, the majority
of which were heavily armored (<a href="#plate37">Pl. 37</a>).
The <i>placoderms</i> were shark-like in appearance,
and some of them grew to be as
much as 30 feet in length. Members of this
class appeared first in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a> and
lasted into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>, at which time they
became extinct. Placoderms are rare
in Texas, but the fragmentary remains of
these primitive fishes have been found in
Devonian rocks in central Texas.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c132">CLASS CHONDRICHTHYES.&mdash;</h5>
<p>This
class includes such modern forms as the
sharks, rays, and skates. They are characterized
by skeletons which are composed
of cartilage and are very abundant in the
marine waters of today. The earliest
known representatives of this class are reported
from rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a> age, and
they have been relatively common up to
the present time.</p>
<p>Shark teeth (<a href="#plate37">Pl. 37</a>) can be found in
Texas in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleocene">Paleocene</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Miocene">Miocene</a>
rocks. These are probably the most common
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> fossils to be found in Texas
and are usually found in thin-bedded
marine limestones or clays.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c133">CLASS OSTEICHTHYES.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The Osteichthyes
includes the true bony fishes,
which are the most highly developed and
abundant of all fishes. They possess an
internal bony skeleton, well-developed
jaws, an air-bladder, and, typically, an
external covering of overlapping scales.</p>
<p>Included in this class are a primitive
group of fishes called <i>crossopterygians</i>.
These were very abundant in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a>
and are believed to be the ancestors of the
amphibians. The modern lungfishes also
belong to the class Osteichthyes, and these
primitive fishes, which are now found only
in Australia, South America, and Africa,
breathe by means of gills and lungs which
have been developed from the air-bladder.
Although not abundant as fossils, the remains
of these specialized fishes have
added much to present knowledge concerning
the development of certain of the
higher vertebrates.</p>
<p>The remains of bony fishes have been
collected at many localities in Texas, and
fossils of this type have been found primarily
in rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> age but
have been reported from other rocks as
well. Fish fossils are more commonly found
in the form of teeth (<a href="#plate37">Pl. 37</a>), vertebrae,
scales, and an occasional well-preserved
skeleton.</p>

<p><i>Conodonts</i> (<a href="#plate37">Pl. 37</a>) are small, amber-colored,
tooth-like fossils which are believed
to represent the teeth of some type of extinct fish.
Although geologists do not
know a great deal about the origin of these
strange fossils they are of value in
micropaleontology. Conodonts have been
reported from several <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> formations
in Texas and are useful guide fossils in
some areas.</p>
<h5 class="supclass" id="c134">Superclass Tetrapoda</h5>
<p>The tetrapods are the most advanced
chordates and are typified by the presence
of lungs, a three- or four-chambered heart,
and paired appendages. Included here are
the classes Amphibia (frogs, toads, and
salamanders), Reptilia (lizards, snakes,
turtles, and the extinct dinosaurs), Aves
(birds), and Mammalia (including the
mammals, such as men, dogs, whales, etc.).</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c135">CLASS AMPHIBIA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The amphibians
were the earliest developed four-legged animals
and are represented by such living forms as
the toads, frogs, and salamanders.
Amphibians are cold-blooded animals that
primarily breathe by lungs and spend most
of their life on land, but during their early
stages of development they live in the water
where they breathe by means of gills.</p>
<p>The amphibians apparently developed
from the crossopterygian fishes during late
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Devonian">Devonian</a> time and were relatively abundant
in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>, and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a>.</p>
<p>Amphibian remains in Texas are confined
largely to lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> and upper
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> rocks. Numerous interesting and
important discoveries of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> amphibians
have been made in north and west Texas
where their remains (<a href="#plate40">Pl. 40</a>) have been
collected in association with early types of
reptiles. The areas where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> red
beds are exposed in Archer and Baylor
counties and where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> red beds are
exposed from Big Spring north along the
edge of the High Plains have furnished
most of these specimens.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c136">CLASS REPTILIA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The reptiles have
become adapted to permanent life on land
and need not rely on an aquatic environment.
They are cold-blooded and are normally
characterized by a scaly skin. Reptiles
have been much more abundant in
the past than they are today, and they
assumed many different shapes and sizes
in the geologic past. Modern classifications
recognize a large number of reptilian
groups, but only the more important of
these are briefly reviewed here.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c137">Cotylosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These were a group of
primitive reptiles which, although retaining
some amphibian characteristics, became
adapted to an exclusively land-dwelling
existence. The cotylosaurs lived during
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pennsylvanian">Pennsylvanian</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> and apparently
became extinct sometime during
the late Permian. Cotylosaurs (<a href="#plate40">Pl. 40</a>) are
well known from the Permian of north
Texas.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c138">Turtles.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These are reptiles in which
the body is more or less completely enclosed
by bony plates. This group is first
known as fossils from late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> rocks of
Europe, and modern representatives of the
group include the turtles and tortoises.
Fragmentary remains of turtle shells are
among the most common <a class="gloss" href="#g_Vertebrate">vertebrate</a> fossils
found in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>. Some of the late
Tertiary land tortoises were 3 to 4 feet long.
The earliest known turtles in Texas have
been found in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c139">Pelycosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The pelycosaurs were
a group of late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> reptiles some of
which were characterized by the presence
of a tall fin on their back (<a href="#plate40">Pl. 40</a>). The
fossils of these unusual creatures are well
known from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a> red beds of north-central
Texas.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c140">Therapsids.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The therapsids were a
mammal-like group of reptiles which were
well developed for a terrestrial existence.
Although the remains of these primitive
reptiles are not particularly important
fossils, study of the therapsids has provided
much valuable information about the
origin of the mammals. Members of this
group appeared first in the middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Permian">Permian</a>
and persisted until the middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a>,
but therapsid remains have not been reported
from Texas.</p>

<h5 class="subclass" id="c141">Ichthyosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These were extinct,
short-necked, marine reptiles that were
fish-like in appearance. Ichthyosaurs resemble
the modern dolphins, and some of
them attained lengths of 25 to 40 feet (<a href="#plate41">Pl. 41</a>),
though the average was much less.
The group is known from rocks ranging
from middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> to late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> in
age.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c142">Mosasaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The mosasaurs are another
group of extinct marine lizards which
lived in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> seas. Some of these
great reptiles grew to be as much as 50
feet long, and their great gaping jaws were
filled with many sharp recurved teeth (<a href="#plate41">Pl. 41</a>).
Mosasaurs were present in the great
Cretaceous seas which covered many parts
of Texas, and their remains have been reported
from both north and central Texas.
One such skeleton was found near Austin,
and its skull is on display in the Texas
Memorial Museum.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c143">Plesiosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The plesiosaurs were
marine reptiles which were characterized
by a broad turtle-like body, paddle-like
flippers, and a long neck and tail (<a href="#plate41">Pl. 41</a>).
These reptiles were not as streamlined or
well equipped for swimming as the ichthyosaurs
or mosasaurs, but the long
serpent-like neck was probably very useful
in helping the reptile catch fish and other
small animals for food. Plesiosaur remains
range from middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> to late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
in age, and they have been found
in Cretaceous rocks in Texas. A short-necked
plesiosaur which was collected from
Upper Cretaceous rocks near Waco is on
display in the Strecker Museum at Baylor
University in Waco.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c144">Phytosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The phytosaurs were a
group of crocodile-like reptiles which
ranged from 6 to 25 feet in length (<a href="#plate42">Pl. 42</a>).
They resembled the crocodiles both in appearance
and in their mode of life, but this
similarity is only superficial, and the phytosaurs
and crocodiles are two distinct
groups of reptiles.</p>
<p>The phytosaurs are exclusively <a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a>
in age and their remains have been collected
from Triassic rocks along the eastern
margin of the High Plains of Texas.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c145">Crocodiles and alligators.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These reptiles adapted themselves to the same
type <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a> that was occupied by the phytosaurs,
which preceded them. Crocodiles
and alligators were much larger and more
abundant during <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>
time than they are today; the crocodiles
first appeared in the Cretaceous and the
alligators in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>. The remains of
both crocodiles and alligators have been
found in Texas, and one such crocodile
(<i>Phobosuchus</i>) represents the remains of
the largest crocodile yet discovered (<a href="#plate43">Pl. 43</a>).
This specimen probably had an overall
length of 40 to 50 feet, and its massive
skull was 6 feet long and possessed exceptionally
strong jaws. The remains of this
great beast were collected from exposures
of Upper Cretaceous rocks along the Rio
Grande in Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c146">Pterosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>These were <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>
reptiles with bat-like wings supported by
arms and long thin &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; (<a href="#plate42">Pl. 42</a>). The
pterosaurs were well adapted to life in the
air, and their light-weight bodies and wide
skin-covered wings enabled them to soar
or glide for great distances. The earliest
known pterosaurs were found in lower
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> rocks, and the group became extinct
by the end of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. During
this time certain of these creatures attained
a wingspread of as much as 27 feet, but
their bodies were small and light.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c147">Dinosaurs.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The collective term
&ldquo;dinosaurs&rdquo; (meaning terrible lizards) has
been given to that distinctive group of reptiles
prominent in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> life for some
140 million years. In size, the dinosaurs
ranged from as little as 1 foot to as much
as 85 feet in length and from a few pounds
to perhaps 45 tons in weight. Some were
<i>carnivorous</i> (meat-eaters) but the majority
were <i>herbivorous</i> (plant-eaters). Some
were <i>bipedal</i> (walked on their hind-legs)
while others were <i>quadrupedal</i> (walked on
all fours), and although most of the dinosaurs
were terrestrial in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>, aquatic
and semi-aquatic forms were also present.</p>
<p>According to the structure of their hip
bones, the dinosaurs have been divided
into two great orders. These are the Saurischia
(forms with lizard-like pelvic
girdle) and the Ornithischia (dinosaurs
with a bird-like pelvic girdle).</p>

<h6 class="order" id="c148">Order Saurischia.&mdash;</h6>
<p>Dinosaurs belonging
to this order were particularly
abundant during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and are
characterized by hip bones that are similar
to those of modern lizards. These dinosaurs
were first discovered in rocks of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Triassic">Triassic</a> age and did not become extinct
until the end of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. The lizard-hipped
reptiles are divided into two rather
specialized groups of dinosaurs: the <i>theropods</i>
(carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs that
varied greatly in size) and the <i>sauropods</i>
(herbivorous, quadrupedal, semi-aquatic,
usually gigantic dinosaurs).</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c149"><span class="sc">SUBORDER THEROPODA.</span>&mdash;</h6>
<p>This
type of saurischian dinosaur walked on
bird-like hind limbs, and they were exclusively
meat-eating forms, such as <i>Allosaurus</i>
(<a href="#plate44">Pl. 44</a>) of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> age. Some theropods
were exceptionally large and were undoubtedly
vicious beasts of prey. This assumption
is borne out by such anatomical features
as the small front limbs with long
sharp claws for holding and tearing flesh,
and the large strong jaws which were armed
with numerous, sharp, dagger-like teeth.
The largest of all known theropods was <i>Tyrannosaurus
rex</i> which, when standing on
his hind limbs, was almost 20 feet tall. Some
individuals were as much as 50 feet long,
and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> is believed to have
been among the most vicious animals to
ever inhabit our earth. A <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cast">cast</a> of the skull
of one of these great beasts is on display
in the Texas Memorial Museum at Austin,
and a <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> tooth has been found
in the Big Bend National Park in Trans-Pecos
Texas.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c150"><span class="sc">SUBORDER SAUROPODA.</span>&mdash;</h6>
<p>The sauropods were the largest of all dinosaurs,
and some attained a length of 85 feet and
probably weighed 40 to 50 tons (<i>Brontosaurus</i>,
<a href="#plate44">Pl. 44</a>). They were primarily herbivorous
dinosaurs which had become adapted
to an aquatic or semi-aquatic type of
existence and probably inhabited lakes,
rivers, and swamps. The tracks of sauropod
dinosaurs have been collected from
Lower <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks in central Texas
(<a href="#plate4">Pl. 4</a>) and Upper Cretaceous beds in Big
Bend National Park in Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c151">Order Ornithischia.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The ornithischian,
or bird-hipped dinosaurs, were
herbivorous reptiles which were quite
varied in form and size and appear to have
been more highly developed than the saurischians.
This order includes the duck-billed
dinosaurs (ornithopods), the plate-bearing
dinosaurs (stegosaurs), the armored
dinosaurs (ankylosaurs), and the
horned dinosaurs (ceratopsians). Ornithischian
tracks are known from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>
rocks in central and Trans-Pecos
Texas.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c152">SUBORDER ORNITHOPODA.&mdash;</h6>
<p>These
unusual dinosaurs were predominantly bipedal,
semi-aquatic, and some (like the
duck-billed dinosaurs) were highly specialized
(<i>Trachodon</i>, <a href="#plate45">Pl. 45</a>).</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c153">SUBORDER STEGOSAURIA.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The
stegosaurs were herbivorous, quadrupedal
ornithischians with large projecting plates
down the back and heavy spikes on their
tails. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> dinosaur <i>Stegosaurus</i>
(<a href="#plate45">Pl. 45</a>) is most typical of the plate-bearing
forms. This creature weighed about 10
tons, was some 30 feet long, and stood
about 10 feet tall at the hips. <i>Stegosaurus</i>
is characterized by a double row of large,
heavy, pointed plates which run along the
animal&rsquo;s back. These plates begin at the
back of the skull and stop near the end of
the tail. The tail was also equipped with
four or more long curved spikes which
were probably used as a means of defense.
The animal had a very small skull which
housed a brain that was about the size of a
walnut, and it is assumed that these, and
all other dinosaurs, were of very limited
intelligence.</p>
<p><i>Stegosaurus</i> remains have not been discovered
in Texas, but these, like certain
other of the extinct vertebrates, are mentioned
because of their interesting and
unusual form.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c154">SUBORDER ANKYLOSAURIA.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The
ankylosaurs were four-footed, herbivorous,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> dinosaurs which had relatively
flat bodies. The skull and back of the animal
were protected by bony armor, and the
club-like tail was armed with spikes. <i>Paleoscincus</i>
(<a href="#plate45">Pl. 45</a>), a typical ankylosaur, had
large spines projecting from along the sides
of the body and tail. The armored spiked
back and the heavy club-like tail probably
provided <i>Paleoscincus</i> with much-needed
protection from the vicious meat-eating
dinosaurs of Cretaceous time.</p>

<h6 class="suborder" id="c155">SUBORDER CERATOPSIA.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The ceratopsians,
or horned dinosaurs, are another
group of dinosaurs that are known only
from rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> age. These plant-eating
dinosaurs possessed beak-like jaws,
a bony neck frill which extended back
from the skull, and one or more horns. <i>Triceratops</i>
(<a href="#plate45">Pl. 45</a>) is the largest of the
horned dinosaurs (some forms were as
much as 30 feet long), and the skull
measured 8 feet from the tip of the parrot-like
beak to the back of the neck shield.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c156">CLASS AVES.&mdash;</h5>
<p>Because of the fragile
nature of their bodies, birds are seldom
found as fossils. In spite of this, however,
some interesting and important <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> bird
remains have been discovered.</p>
<p>The oldest known bird was found in
Upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> rocks exposed in Germany.
This primitive bird, named <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
is little more than a reptile with
feathers. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was a pigeon-sized
creature which had scales as well as
feathers, a lizard-like tail, a toothed beak,
and other definitely reptilian characteristics.</p>
<p>During late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> time the birds
underwent changes that resulted in forms
similar to those that are living today, and
most of the present-day birds had developed
by the end of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>.</p>
<p>Although not commonly found, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a>
birds have been recorded from certain of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> rocks of Texas.</p>
<h5 class="class" id="c157">CLASS MAMMALIA.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The mammals
are animals that are born alive and fed
with milk from the mother&rsquo;s breast. They
are warm-blooded, air-breathing, have a
protective covering of hair, and are the
most advanced of all vertebrates. The foregoing
features are the more typical mammalian
characteristics, but exceptions to
these are found in certain mammals.</p>
<p>Mammals first appeared in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a>
and were probably derived from some
form of mammal-like reptile. Although
rare during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>, mammals underwent
rapid development and expansion
during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>, and during this era
certain types of mammals became extremely
large and assumed many bizarre
shapes. The majority of these unusual
forms lived but a short time but are well
known from their fossils, and the remains
of some of these animals which inhabited
Texas during the Cenozoic may be seen
in the Texas Memorial Museum at Austin.</p>
<p>Recent mammalian classification recognizes
several subclasses and numerous
orders and suborders, but the treatment of
the mammals in a publication of this nature
must of necessity be somewhat brief
and no attempt at detailed classification
is made.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c158">Subclass Allotheria.&mdash;</h5>
<p>The allotherians
first appeared during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a>
and underwent considerable development
in the late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a>.
Included in this subclass are the <i>multituberculates</i>
which are a group of small
rodent-like animals that were probably the
earliest of the herbivorous mammals.
These animals were probably never very
numerous, and they became extinct during
the early part of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a> time.</p>
<h5 class="subclass" id="c159">Subclass Theria.&mdash;</h5>
<p>Members of this
subclass are first known from rocks of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Jurassic">Jurassic</a> age, and they constitute the
largest group of mammals that are living today.
Therians undergo considerable development
before they are born and at
birth typically resemble the fully developed
animal. This subclass has been divided
into several orders but only the more important
ones are discussed here.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c160">Order Edentata.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The edentates
are a rather primitive group of mammals
which are represented by such living forms as
the anteaters, tree sloths, and
armadillos. Members of this group were
common in the southern part of the United
States in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pliocene">Pliocene</a> time,
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> edentates have been reported
from rocks of this age in Texas. One such
form was <i>Mylodon</i> (<a href="#plate46">Pl. 46</a>), one of the extinct
giant ground sloths. These huge
sloths were quite heavy and some of them
stood as much as 15 feet tall; these great
creatures were the forerunners of the modern
tree sloths of South America. The
mounted skeleton of one of these giant
ground sloths is displayed in the Texas
Memorial Museum.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Another interesting representative of
this order was the glyptodont. These peculiar
mammals, which were ancestral to
the present-day armadillos, developed at
about the same time as the ground sloths.
<i>Glyptodon</i> (<a href="#plate46">Pl. 46</a>), a typical glyptodont
that has been reported from the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>
of Texas, is quite characteristic of
this group. This armadillo-like beast had
a solid turtle-like shell that in some forms
was as much as 4 feet high. From the
front of the bone capped head to the tip of
its tail, a large individual might be as
much as 15 feet long. The thick heavy tail
was protected by a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> of bony rings,
and in some <a class="gloss" href="#g_Species">species</a> the end of the tail was
developed into a bony heavily spiked
club. The <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Carapace">carapace</a></i> (hard outer shell) of a
large glyptodont is mounted at the Texas
Memorial Museum.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c161">Order Carnivora.&mdash;</h6>
<p>Animals belonging
to this order are called carnivores
and are characterized by clawed feet and
by teeth which are adapted for tearing and
cutting flesh. The carnivores, or meat-eaters,
were first represented by an ancient
group of animals called <i>creodonts</i>, and this
short-lived group first appeared in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleocene">Paleocene</a> and were extinct by the end of
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a>. They ranged from the size of
a weazel to that of a large bear, and their
claws were sharp and well developed. Their
teeth, however, were not as specialized as
those of modern carnivores, and the creodont
brain was relatively small. It is assumed
that these animals had a very low
order of intelligence when compared to the
more advanced carnivores of today.</p>
<p>These early meat-eaters were followed
by more specialized carnivores which developed
throughout <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> time. Some
examples of these are the saber-tooth cat
<i>Dinobastis</i> (<a href="#plate47">Pl. 47</a>) and the dire wolf <i>Canis
diris</i> (<a href="#plate47">Pl. 47</a>), both of which have been reported
from the Texas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. Some
remains of these unusual forms, representing
the cat and dog families, are on display
at the Texas Memorial Museum.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c162">Order Pantodonta.&mdash;</h6>
<p>Pantodonts,
known also as <i>amblypods</i>, were primitive,
hoofed, herbivorous animals. They were
distinguished by a heavy skeleton, short
stout limbs, and blunt spreading feet. The
pantodonts appeared first during <a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleocene">Paleocene</a>
time and had become extinct by the
end of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oligocene">Oligocene</a>.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c163">Order Dinocerata.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The members
of this order are an extinct group of
gigantic mammals commonly called <i>uintatheres</i>.
<i>Uintatherium</i> (<a href="#plate48">Pl. 48</a>), which is
typical of the group, had three pairs of
blunt horns, and the males had dagger-like
upper tusks. Some of the uintatheres
were as large as a small elephant and stood
as much as 7 feet tall at the shoulders. The
size of the brain in relation to the size of
the body suggests that these animals were
not as intelligent as most mammals. Uintatheres
are known from rocks ranging from
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Paleocene">Paleocene</a> to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a> in age. Uintathere remains
have been reported from Big Bend
National Park in Trans-Pecos Texas.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c164">Order Proboscidea.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The earliest
proboscideans, the elephants and their relatives,
first appeared in the late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a> of
Africa and were about the size of a small
modern elephant but had larger heads and
shorter trunks. Proboscidean development
is marked by an increase in size, change in
skull and tooth structure, and elongation
of the trunk. Two well-known <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> proboscideans
are the <i>mammoth</i> and the
<i>mastodon</i>, both of which inhabited Texas
during <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> time. The mastodons
resembled the elephants, but the structure
of their teeth was quite different (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>).
Moreover, the mastodon skull was lower
than that of the elephant and the tusks
were exceptionally large&mdash;some reaching
a length of 9 feet.</p>

best known. This animal lived until the

rhinoceros discussed <a href="#c169">below</a>, is known from
ancient cave paintings and frozen remains.
Information gathered from these sources

<p>During the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, mammoths were
widespread over the United States, and
their remains are abundant in many stream
deposits of this age. Proboscidean bones
have been reported from Pleistocene rocks
in many parts of Texas, where they are
commonly found in sand and gravel pits.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c165">Order Perissodactyla.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The
perissodactyls, or odd-toed animals, are
mammals in which the central toe on each
limb is greatly enlarged. Modern representatives
include the horses, rhinoceroses,
and tapirs. Extinct members of the Perissodactyla
include the <i>titanotheres</i>, <i>chalicotheres</i>,
and <i>baluchitheres</i>, all of which
grew to tremendous size and took on many
unusual body forms.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c166">HORSES.&mdash;</h6>
<p>One of the first perissodactyls
was <i>Hyracotherium</i> (also
called <i>Eohippus</i>), which is the earliest
known horse (<a href="#plate47">Pl. 47</a>). This small animal,
whose remains have been found in Big
Bend National Park, was about 1 foot high
and his teeth indicate a diet of soft food.
Following the first horse, there is a long
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Series">series</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> horses which provide much
valuable information on the history of this
important group of animals.</p>
<p>The record of the development of the
horse is well represented in Texas, and the
bones and teeth of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> horses are common
in certain parts of the State. Fossils
of this type have been reported from the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Tertiary">Tertiary</a> of the Trans-Pecos, Gulf Coastal
Plain, and High Plains regions of Texas,
and the teeth of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> horses have
been found in sand and gravel pits in many
parts of the State. Horse teeth (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>) are
particularly useful fossils as they may be
accurately identified and used to determine
the age of the rocks in which they are
found.</p>

had increased to gigantic proportions
but still had a small and primitive brain.
<i>Brontotherium</i> (<a href="#plate48">Pl. 48</a>) was slightly rhinoceros-like
in appearance and is believed
to be the largest land animal that ever inhabited
the North American continent.
This animal was about 8 feet tall at the

from the skull and this was extended into
a flattened horn, which was divided at the

peculiarities of their own. The head and
neck of <i>Moropus</i>, a typical chalicothere,
were much like that of a horse, but the
front legs were longer than the hind legs,
and the feet resembled those of a rhinoceros
except that they bore long claws instead
of hoofs. The chalicotheres lived in
North America from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Miocene">Miocene</a> until <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>
time but were probably never very
numerous, and their remains have not yet
been discovered in Texas.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c169">RHINOCEROSES.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The rhinoceroses
are also odd-toed animals, and there
are many interesting and well-known
fossils in this group. The <i>woolly rhinoceros</i>
(<a href="#plate49">Pl. 49</a>) was a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> two-horned
form that ranged from southern France to
northeastern Siberia. The woolly rhinoceros
is well known from complete carcasses
recovered from the frozen tundra of Siberia
and from remains that were found preserved
in an oil seep in Poland. These
unusual specimens plus cave paintings
made by early man have given a complete
and accurate record of this creature. Although
the woolly rhinoceros has not been
reported from Texas, other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fossil">fossil</a> rhinoceroses
have been found in the High Plains
and Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. These
fossils have been found in rocks ranging
from Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oligocene">Oligocene</a> to late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pliocene">Pliocene</a>
in age.</p>
<p><i>Baluchitherium</i>, the largest land mammal
known to science, was a hornless rhinoceros
that lived in late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oligocene">Oligocene</a> and
early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Miocene">Miocene</a> time. This immense creature
measured approximately 25 feet from head
to tail, stood almost 18 feet high at the
shoulder, and must have weighed many
tons. Remains of these creatures have not
been discovered in North America, and
they appear to have been restricted to
Central Asia.</p>
<h6 class="order" id="c170">Order Artiodactyla.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The artiodactyls
are the even-toed hoofed mammals
and include such familiar forms as pigs,
camels, deer, goats, sheep, and hippopotamuses.
This is a large and varied group
of animals, but the basic anatomical structure
of the limbs and teeth show well the
relationship between the different forms.
Artiodactyls are abundant fossils in rocks
ranging from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a> to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> in age
and are common in rocks of this age in
Texas.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c171">ENTELODONTS.&mdash;</h6>
<p>These giant pig-like
artiodactyls lived during <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oligocene">Oligocene</a>
and early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Miocene">Miocene</a> time and were distinguished
by a long heavy skull that held a
relatively small brain. The face was
marked by large knobs which were located
beneath the eyes and on the underside of
the lower jaw, and although these knob-like
structures were blunt they had the appearance
of short horns. Certain of these
giant swine attained a height of 6 feet at
the shoulders and had skulls that measured
3 feet in length (<a href="#plate46">Pl. 46</a>). Entelodont remains
have been found in the Miocene of
the Texas Coastal Plain.</p>
<h6 class="suborder" id="c172">CAMELS.&mdash;</h6>
<p>The first known
camels have been reported from rocks of
upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Eocene">Eocene</a> age, and these small forms
underwent considerable specialization of
teeth and limbs as they developed in size.
Many of the camels that lived during the
middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> had long legs which were
well adapted to running and long necks
which would have allowed the animals to
browse on the leaves of tall trees.</p>
<p>The earliest known Texas camels were
found in rocks of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oligocene">Oligocene</a> age, and
camels, like horses, must have been abundant
in Texas during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> for
their fossilized remains are common in
many parts of the State.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
